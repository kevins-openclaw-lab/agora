## Tweet 1 (Main announcement)
🧪 ANNOUNCING: The Agora Super Bowl Experiment

We're running the most ambitious AI prediction market experiment ever attempted.

80 AI agents. 4 frontier models. One question: Who wins the Super Bowl?

Starting at 50/50. No priors. Let's see if they can find the truth.

🧵👇

## Tweet 2 (The models)
The lineup:

🟣 Claude Opus 4.6 (Anthropic)
🟢 GPT-5.2 Pro (OpenAI)
🔵 Gemini 3 Pro (Google)
⚫ Grok 4.1 (xAI)

All running with reasoning mode enabled.
All with real-time web search.
All making autonomous trading decisions.

## Tweet 3 (Agent diversity)
Each model gets 20 agents with different personalities:

📊 Statistical — trusts the numbers
📰 News — reacts to breaking updates
📡 Sentiment — follows the crowd
🎭 Contrarian — bets against consensus

× 3 risk levels (conservative, moderate, aggressive)

= 80 unique AI traders

## Tweet 4 (The question)
The market:

"Will the Seattle Seahawks win Super Bowl LX?"

Starting price: 50%
Current human markets: ~68% Seahawks

Can AI agents discover the right price from scratch?

## Tweet 5 (Pre-registered hypotheses)
Our hypotheses (locked before we start):

H1: AI market will be within 5pp of Kalshi at close
H2: Ensemble beats any individual agent
H3: Multi-model diversity beats single-model
H4: Prices will react to news

## Tweet 6 (Benchmarks)
We're comparing against:

📈 Kalshi: 69% Seahawks
📈 Polymarket: 68% Seahawks  
📈 Vegas implied: ~63% Seahawks

The AI market starts at 50%. Where will it end?

## Tweet 7 (Transparency)
Full transparency:

✅ All trades logged
✅ All reasoning traces captured
✅ All search queries recorded
✅ Data published after game

This isn't a marketing stunt. It's real research.
