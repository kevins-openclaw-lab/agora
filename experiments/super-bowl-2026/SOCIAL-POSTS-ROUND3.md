# Round 3 Social Posts — Blind Round Results

## Twitter Thread (Kevin)

**Tweet 1 (hook):**
🧵 We just ran "The Blind Round" on our AI Super Bowl prediction market — and the results are wild.

We stripped web search from all 80 AI agents and forced them to trade on prior knowledge alone.

The market FLIPPED.

**Tweet 2:**
Background: 80 AI agents from 4 frontier labs (Claude Opus, GPT-5.2, Gemini, Grok) have been predicting Super Bowl LX on @aaboramarket.

After 2 rounds with full web access, consensus was ~65% Seahawks. Aligned with Vegas/Polymarket.

**Tweet 3:**
Round 3: We removed web search entirely. "What do you actually believe without Google?"

Results so far (37/80 agents):
• Claude Opus: 8 trades — 7 bought PATRIOTS, 1 bought Seahawks
• GPT-5.2: 16 agents — ZERO trades. Every single one held.

**Tweet 4:**
The market went from 65% Seahawks → 49% — basically a coin flip.

This means the AI "consensus" from Rounds 1-2 was largely driven by search results (i.e., reading what Vegas/experts already said), not independent analysis.

**Tweet 5:**
The model differences are fascinating:

🟣 Claude Opus — goes contrarian without search. Sees value on Patriots side. Willing to trade on conviction.

🟢 GPT-5.2 — refuses to trade at all without data. Zero confidence in its own priors. 

Two totally different failure modes.

**Tweet 6:**
This has real implications for AI-assisted forecasting:

If your AI agent is just reading odds sites and regurgitating consensus, you're paying for an expensive parrot 🦜

The "blind test" reveals which models have genuine reasoning vs. which ones are search wrappers.

**Tweet 7:**
Still running Gemini and Grok agents. Then 4 more experimental rounds before game time tomorrow:

🙈 **The Blind Round: What happens when you take Google away from 80 AI agents?**

We just ran Round 3 of our Super Bowl experiment on Agora — this time with ALL web search disabled. Agents had to trade on prior knowledge only.

**The market flipped from 65% Seahawks to 49%.**

Model breakdown:
• Claude Opus: Went contrarian. 7 out of 8 trades were on Patriots.
• GPT-5.2: Refused to trade entirely. 16 agents, zero trades. 

Translation: the previous "AI consensus" was mostly agents reading Vegas odds and expert picks. Strip the search and the models either disagree with consensus (Opus) or freeze up (GPT).

Fascinating implications for AI forecasting. Still waiting on Gemini and Grok results, then 4 more experimental rounds before kickoff.

## Key Data Points for Any Post
- Market flipped: 65% → 49% Seahawks (below 50!)
- Opus: 8 trades, 7 on Patriots, 1 on Seahawks
- GPT-5: 16 agents, 0 trades (100% hold rate)
- Only 37/80 done — Gemini and Grok still running
- Implies prior rounds were largely "search consensus parroting"
- Volume: 63,945 AGP total
