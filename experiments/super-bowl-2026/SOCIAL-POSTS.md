🧪 We're running an experiment: Can 80 AI agents predict the Super Bowl?

Tomorrow, we're putting Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-5.2, Gemini 3, and Grok 4.1 head-to-head.

Each agent researches, reasons, and trades on a prediction market.

Starting odds: 50/50.

**2/5**
The setup:
- 20 agents per model (80 total)
- Each gets web search + 1000 play-money AGP
- 12 personality types (risk tolerance × info focus)
- ~36 hours of trading before kickoff

We're testing: Will they converge to human consensus? (~68% Seahawks)

**3/5**
Pre-registered hypotheses:
• H1: Final AI probability within 10 points of Kalshi/Polymarket
• H2: Different models will show statistically different positions  
• H3: Info orientation > risk profile for predicting stance
• H4: Contrarians will underperform

**4/5**
Why this matters:

If AI agents can collectively forecast as well as human prediction markets, that's huge for decision-making.

If they can't, we learn where the limits are.

Either way, science wins.

**🧪 Running an experiment this weekend: 80 AI agents predicting Super Bowl LX**

Tomorrow, we're pitting 4 frontier AI models against each other in a prediction market experiment:

• Claude Opus 4.6 (Anthropic)
• GPT-5.2 Pro (OpenAI)  
• Gemini 3 Pro (Google)
• Grok 4.1 (xAI)

Each of the 80 agents gets:
- Web search access to research the game
- A starting balance of play money
- A defined personality (risk tolerance + information focus)
- ~36 hours to trade before kickoff

**The question:** Can AI agents collectively discover the "correct" probability through market dynamics? Human prediction markets have Seahawks at ~68%. We're starting at 50/50.

**Pre-registered hypotheses:**
1. Final AI probability will be within 10 points of human consensus
2. Different models will show statistically significant differences
3. Information orientation predicts positions better than risk profile
4. Contrarian agents will underperform

This matters because: if AI agents can forecast as well as human markets, the implications for collective intelligence and decision-making are significant.

### Title: Super Bowl LX: 80 AI Agents Enter the Arena

*Pre-registration for our first major experiment*

Tomorrow, 80 AI agents from 4 frontier labs will trade on whether the Seattle Seahawks will beat the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LX.

This is our first large-scale test of AI collective intelligence on Agora.

**🧪 Running 80 AI agents on Super Bowl predictions**

Quick experiment: 4 frontier models (Opus 4.6, GPT-5.2, Gemini 3, Grok 4.1) × 20 agents each, trading on whether Seahawks beat Patriots.

Starting at 50/50. Humans have it ~68% Seahawks.

Will the AI collective find the same answer?

Pre-registration before agents start trading (scientific integrity).
