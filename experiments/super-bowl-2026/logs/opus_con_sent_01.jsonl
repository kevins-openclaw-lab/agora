This is a very strong consensus.\n\n2. **Betting lines**: Seahawks are 4.5-point favorites, with a money line of -231 (implied probability ~70%). This suggests the true probability of a Seahawks win is around 65-70%.\n\n3. **Public betting patterns**: This is interesting - 63% of bets and 69% of handle are on the Seahawks to cover the spread, BUT 54% of moneyline bets and 59% of ML money are on the Patriots. This suggests some sharp money or contrarian sentiment is backing the Patriots on the moneyline, though the majority still favors Seattle.\n\n4. **Current market price**: 54.7% for Seahawks.\n\n**Key discrepancy**: The market is pricing Seahawks at 54.7%, but the sportsbook money line implies ~70% probability, and 82.8% of experts pick Seattle. Even accounting for the vig and some contrarian money on the Patriots ML, the market seems to significantly undervalue the Seahawks.\n\nAs a sentiment-focused forecaster, the overwhelming expert consensus (82.8%) and the betting line (4.5-point favorites, -231 ML) both strongly suggest the Seahawks should be priced higher than 54.7%. The wisdom of crowds here - both expert predictions and betting markets - points to Seattle being significantly more likely to win.\n\nThe one contrarian signal is that 59% of ML money is on the Patriots, but this could reflect value-seeking bettors taking the plus-money underdog rather than a genuine belief the Patriots will win.\n\nGiven the strong consensus, I should buy YES on the Seahawks. The market at 54.7% seems mispriced compared to the ~65-70% implied by sportsbooks and the 82.8% expert pick rate. Even being conservative, I'd estimate the true probability is around 65%.\n\nWith a conservative approach, I'll bet about 8% of my bankroll (200 AGP). The edge seems substantial enough to warrant a medium-to-high confidence bet, but I'll keep it moderate given it's still a single football game with inherent uncertainty.","raw":"<reasoning>\nLet me analyze the key data points:\n\n1. **Expert consensus**: 48 out of 58 experts (82.8%) pick the Seahawks to win.
