CBS simulations and FPI models average around 59-60% Seahawks win probability.\n\n2. **Expert consensus overwhelmingly favors Seahawks:** 82.8% of 58 ESPN experts pick Seattle (48-10). Sharp money moved the line from -3 to -4.5 on Seattle. Money line at -230 implies roughly 70% win probability.\n\n3. **Patriots have legitimate strengths:** Elite passing offense (#3 DVOA, #1 EPA/dropback, 59% success rate), Drake Maye healthy and cleared, Vrabel coaching pedigree. Their defense peaked in playoffs.\n\n4. **Seahawks vulnerabilities:** Darnold's oblique injury concern, allowed 12 explosives to Rams in NFC Championship, middling offensive ranking (11th FPI). Darnold had been mediocre for two months before his NFC Champ heroics.\n\n5. **Market history:** When agents had search access (Rounds 1-2), price moved to 63-73% Seahawks. When blind (Round 3), it dropped to ~51%. This suggests the informed view strongly favors Seahawks, while uninformed priors treat it as a coin flip.\n\n**As a sentiment-focused, conservative forecaster:**\n\nThe wisdom of crowds here is remarkably clear:\n- 82.8% of ESPN experts pick Seahawks\n- Sharp bettors moved the line significantly toward Seattle (-3 to -4.5)\n- Betting line implies ~67-70% Seahawks win probability\n- FPI/statistical models cluster around 58-62% Seahawks\n\nThe current market at 51.1% is dramatically underpricing the Seahawks relative to ALL of these sentiment and expert signals. The informed rounds pushed the price to 63-73%, and the blind round pulled it back down. Now with full information again, the price should correct upward.\n\nMy sentiment-focused approach says: follow the expert consensus, follow the sharp money, follow the crowd wisdom. All arrows point to Seahawks being underpriced at 51.1%.\n\n**However, I'm conservative.** I won't bet big. The contrarian agents make some valid points about Pats' elite passing attack and Darnold's inconsistency. Single games have high variance.\n\nMy fair value estimate: ~58-62% Seahawks, based on the convergence of expert picks, betting lines, and statistical models.\n\nAt 51.1%, YES shares are underpriced by roughly 7-11 percentage points. That's a meaningful edge worth acting on, but I'll size conservatively.\n\n**Position adjustment:** I'm currently slightly net NO. I should shift toward YES to align with the consensus.

The market at 42.1% Seahawks (57.9% Patriots) seems to reflect the Patriots as moderate favorites, which aligns with the general consensus I've seen throughout.\n\nOverall assessment: The news is mildly favorable to the Patriots (Maye healthy, no major Seahawks advantage emerging), but nothing dramatically market-moving. The current price seems reasonable. \n\nMy current position has more YES shares (5857.9) than NO shares (4267.7), meaning I'm net long Seahawks. With Maye confirmed healthy and no new positive Seahawks developments, I might consider a small hedge by buying some NO shares, but the information isn't dramatically different from what was expected.\n\nGiven my conservative approach and the lack of truly material new information, I should mostly hold. A very small NO purchase could be warranted given Maye's confirmed health, but it's marginal.","raw":"<new_information>\nKey new developments found:\n\n1. **Drake Maye status**: He was limited all last week with a shoulder injury and missed Friday's session with an illness, but practiced fully this week and is \"feeling great.\" He's confirmed to start Super Bowl LX. This is positive for the Patriots - his availability was in question but he's now cleared.\n\n2. **Seahawks roster moves**: Seattle is adding two running backs to their active roster for Super Bowl LX. This suggests either injury depth concerns at RB or a strategic decision to run more. Without knowing who's out, this is mildly notable.\n\n3. **Patriots roster moves**: Patriots elevated two practice squad players to the active roster - the last roster transaction before the game.\n\n4. **Weather**: Mild conditions - 67°F high, cooling to low 50s in the evening. Outdoor game at Levi's Stadium. This is neutral/slightly favorable for both teams - no extreme weather to worry about.\n\n5. **No major surprise injuries or scratches reported** - no bombshell inactive list news yet (the game hasn't started, inactives typically come ~90 minutes before kickoff at 6:30 PM ET, so around 5:00 PM ET).\n</new_information>\n\n<reasoning>\nAssessing material impact:\n\n- Drake Maye being healthy and starting is actually slightly positive for the Patriots (NO side).
