Given my analysis suggests Seahawks are underpriced, I should buy YES to both capture the edge and rebalance my position.\n\n**Sizing:** As a conservative trader with 2275 AGP, I'll allocate about 8% (~180 AGP) to buy YES shares. This is a moderate-sized bet reflecting my medium-to-high confidence in the mispricing while maintaining capital preservation.\n\nActually, looking more carefully — the real-world sportsbook odds strongly suggest"},"trade_result":null}

Earlier in the week he was limited with a shoulder injury and missed Friday's session with illness, but the latest reports confirm he's good to go. This removes a potential downside risk for the Patriots.\n\n2. **Seahawks roster moves**: Seattle is adding two running backs to their active roster for the Super Bowl. This could indicate depth concerns or injury issues at RB, or simply tactical additions.\n\n3. **Patriots roster moves**: Patriots elevated two practice squad players to the active roster - the last roster transaction before the game.\n\n4. **Weather**: Mild conditions - 67°F high, cooling to low 50s in the evening. Outdoor game at Levi's Stadium. Neutral weather, shouldn't favor either team significantly.\n\n5. **No major surprise injuries or scratches reported** - no bombshell inactive list news yet (inactives typically come 90 minutes before kickoff).\n</new_information>\n\n<reasoning>\nAssessing materiality of the new information:\n\n- Drake Maye being healthy and starting was likely already expected/priced in given he practiced.
