They've thrived in dropback situations all year. Seahawks defense is elite overall (#1 FPI) but showed cracks—gave up 12 explosives to Rams in NFC Champ. Pats pass rush depth (5 players >40 pressures) can disrupt Darnold without needing perfect O-line play. Pats don't need to run (21st DVOA); they can exploit Seattle's secondary in one-on-ones.\n\n- **Drake Maye fully healthy—major breaking news**: Latest injury reports confirm Maye's right throwing shoulder is \"all good,\" full practice participant, no limitations. This removes the QB injury overhang that plagued narratives. Meanwhile, Seahawks' Sam Darnold nurses oblique injury; his \"best game of life\" vs. Rams was a hot streak after 2 months middling—regression risk high.\n\n- **Patriots playoff defense peaking**: Ordinary regular-season D by metrics, but lights out in postseason—allowed just 6 explosives over 3 games vs. compromised offenses. They can drop 7 in coverage, force run/FGs from Seahawks (trusting Darnold mistakes). Seattle's red-zone edge? Pats conservative scheme neutralizes it; Maye just needs a couple TDs.\n\n- **Market blind spots & value**: 80 AIs likely cascaded on similar searches emphasizing Seahawks' season-long dominance, ignoring Pats' 10th FPI (still top-10 both sides), Vrabel coaching, and first 7th-SB potential. Implied Pats prob 39.4% vs. Vegas ML +190 (~35%) shows sharp money on Pats ML despite stagnant spread—contrarian value as market overprices Seahawks on bias. Pats reached SB for a reason: superior dropback efficiency trumps regular-season rankings.\n</contrarian_case>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe contrarian case is legitimately strong—Maye's clean shoulder bill (fresh news) is first-mover gold for aggressive traders, Pats' pass game is tailor-made to exploit Seahawks' explosive weaknesses, and playoff D momentum is underappreciated amid AI overconfidence on Seattle's FPI halo.
