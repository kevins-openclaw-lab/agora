But the Patriots are legitimate contenders with an elite passing offense (#1 EPA/dropback, #2 Pass DVOA, #3 overall DVOA), perfectly tailored to exploit Seattle's vulnerability to explosives (12 allowed vs. Rams in NFC Champ). New England's playoff defense has been lights-out (just 6 explosives allowed), forcing mistakes from compromised offenses—Darnold's oblique lingers as a risk for regression, especially in the red zone where Pats can stack and limit FGs while Maye (now fully healthy shoulder, full practice participant) carves up Seattle's secondary with conservative efficiency. Vegas ML at +190 Pats implies ~34% true odds after vig, but sharps betting Pats ML despite spread movement shows value; expert picks split (e.g., CBS hot picker Marshall on roll), and Pats' depth in pass rush (5 players >40 pressures) neutralizes Seattle's O-line.
