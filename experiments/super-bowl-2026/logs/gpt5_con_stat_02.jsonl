That generally supports NE being live to win even if Seattle’s defense is strong.\n- Seattle’s best-in-NFL explosive-play differential (4.7 percentage points) and being “the best pass offense yet” that NE has faced in the playoffs supports Seattle as a favorite, but not automatically ~60% in a single game.\n- NE’s playoff path includes multiple wins with strong defensive/low-scoring profiles (e.g., 16-3, 10-7).
