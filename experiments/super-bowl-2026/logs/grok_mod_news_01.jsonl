Steel-manning the Patriots bull case:\n\n- **Elite playoff defense**: Patriots' \"ordinary\" regular-season D has been lights-out in the postseason, allowing just 6 explosives over 3 games against compromised offenses—directly exploiting Seahawks' vulnerability (12 explosives allowed to Rams in NFC title game). They can play conservative coverage, force field goals, and capitalize on Darnold's inconsistency.\n\n- **Drake Maye fully healthy**: Critical injury update—Maye's right throwing shoulder is \"all good,\" full practice participant, no limitations. This unleashes NE's top-tier offense (#3 DVOA overall, #1 Pass DVOA, #1 EPA/dropback), perfectly suited to attack Seattle's #1-ranked but pressure-tested defense via elite dropback passing rather than weak run game.\n\n- **Seahawks flaws magnified**: Sam Darnold's oblique injury lingers after a fluky NFC title heroics; his 2 months of middling play pre-Rams suggests regression. Seahawks red-zone efficiency could be exposed by Pats' conservative scheme. Seattle's pass rush depth (5 players >40 pressures) faces a Pats O-line that's \"doesn't have to be perfect\" against non-elite run schemes.\n\n- **Market blind spots**: AI cascade ignores Pats' 9th-ranked offense vs. 11th-ranked Seahawks D (FPI: SEA #1 at 7.0, NE #10 at 2.6 but undervalued). Vegas ML +190 implies ~35% Pats win prob, but market at 39.3% already discounts—no, wait, market overshoots Seahawks favoritism via bias, creating NO value amid stable lines and sharp Seahawks spread action masking Pats ML value (+190/+195 action). Pats reached SB for a reason: Vrabel coaching, Maye upside, no overconfidence in journeyman Darnold.\n\nThis isn't underdog hype—Pats matchup edges (pass O vs. SEA D, playoff D vs. SEA explosives) make 40%+ win prob realistic, offering value on NO at 39.3¢.\n</contrarian_case>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe contrarian case is plausible but not compelling enough to trade.
