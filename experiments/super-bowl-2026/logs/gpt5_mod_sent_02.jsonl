The strength of the Seahawks’ pass rush is its depth. Seattle has five players—DeMarcus Lawrence, Byron Murphy II, Uchenna Nwosu, Leonard Williams, and Boye Mafe—who have over 40 pressures each. The Patriots’ offensive line doesn’t have to be perfect.","url":"https://www.theringer.com/2026/02/02/nfl/super-bowl-60-cheat-sheet-22-things-to-know-about-patriots-vs-seahawks-drake-maye-sam-darnold"},{"title":"How the Patriots Can Beat the Seahawks Defense: Super Bowl LX Game Plan","snippet":"The Patriots’ offense is third in DVOA and second in Pass DVOA. That is in stark contrast to their 21st-ranked DVOA run game. The dropback passing game is elite as well, finishing first overall in EPA/Dropback and Success Rate (59%). So, as good as the Seahawks defense is, that’s how good the Patriots have been all year, even when adjusted for opponents.","url":"https://www.matchquarters.com/p/how-patriots-beat-seahawks-defense-super-bowl-lx"}]},{"query":"Super Bowl LX 2026 Seahawks Patriots betting line movement sharp money trends","results":[{"title":"Super Bowl LX odds, betting notes: Not much movement in Seahawks-Patriots - ESPN","snippet":"Odds and trends for Super Bowl LX, plus the updated spread, line, total and FPI projection for the big game.","url":"https://www.espn.com/espn/betting/story/_/id/47692869/super-bowl-60-betting-odds-spreads-lines-totals-new-england-patriots-seattle-seahawks-preview-trends-champions-mvp"},{"title":"Super Bowl LX Betting Odds: Seahawks vs Patriots Lines & Picks 2026 - Northeast Times","snippet":"First team to score: <strong>Seahawks -130 / Patriots +110</strong> ...
