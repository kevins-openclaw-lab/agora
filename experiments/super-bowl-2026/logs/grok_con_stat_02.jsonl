This dropback excellence has been consistent against strong defenses. Meanwhile, Seattle's elite D (#1 FPI) showed cracks, allowing 12 explosives to the Rams in the NFC Championship—far more than New England's playoff D (just 6 explosives allowed through 3 games against compromised offenses). Seattle's pass rush depth (5 players >40 pressures) is strong, but Pats OL doesn't need perfection against it.\n\n- **Playoff defense elevation**: Pats D was ordinary regularly but dominant in postseason (limited explosives, faced weaker offenses). Conservative scheme (7-man coverage, split-safety) could force Seahawks to run (elite Pats run D) and exploit Darnold's inconsistency (middling 2 months pre-NFCG outlier game) + oblique injury. Pats red-zone D weakness is noted, but field position game could limit Seattle to FGs.\n\n- **QB health and upside**: Drake Maye fully healthy (shoulder full participant, \"feeling good\"), contrasting Darnold's oblique. Maye leads high-efficiency Pats passing attack.\n\n- **Market biases**: 80 AIs herded on similar searches (anchoring, cascade, correlated models), pushing to 58.9% despite FPI gap (Seahawks 7.0 vs Pats 2.6) overstated by narratives. Pats reached SB for reason—top-10 FPI team with playoff outperformance. Sharp money on Pats ML (+190/+195), line stagnant at Seahawks -4.5 despite some spread movement.\n\nTrue prob for Seahawks closer to 50-55% due to matchup edges, making NO (41.1¢) undervalued vs Vegas-implied ~65-70% overshoot from pro lines.\n</contrarian_case>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe contrarian case for Patriots has statistical merit—elite Pats pass metrics, playoff D improvement, Seahawks explosive vulnerabilities, and QB health asymmetry provide real edges overlooked in AI herd.
