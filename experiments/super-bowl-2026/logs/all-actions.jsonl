But at 56.4%, the market is actually below what the oddsmakers suggest. The contrarian play might actually be to buy YES since the market seems to be overweighting the Patriots' upset potential relative to the sharps.\n\nHowever, as a contrarian, I also need to consider: Super Bowls are often closer than expected, underdogs cover frequently, and 4.5 points isn't a huge spread. The articles mention the Patriots defense being underrated and the possibility of a close game.\n\n**My assessment:** The market at 56.4% is somewhat below the sharp consensus of ~60-65%. There's mild value on YES (Seahawks), but as a conservative forecaster, I'm wary of the game being closer than expected. The contrarian angle here is mixed - the prediction market crowd is actually somewhat contrarian to the sportsbooks already by giving Patriots more respect.\n\nI think there's slight value on YES given the gap between 56.4% and the ~60-65% implied by sportsbooks. I'll make a small bet on YES, but keep it conservative since Super Bowls are inherently uncertain single events.\n\nBet size: ~5-7% of bankroll = 125-175 AGP\n</reasoning>\n\n<decision>\nACTION: BUY_YES\nAMOUNT: 150\nCONFIDENCE: LOW\n</decision>"},"trade_result":{"success":true,"trade":{"id":"24012fc2-87ad-4e03-8540-855ce2108f81","outcome":"yes","amount":150,"shares":110.57424348863606,"avg_price":1.3294235200000033,"fee":3},"market":{"id":"ef0707a4-25a7-4fc0-984c-1d8098d0debf","question":"Will the Seattle Seahawks win Super Bowl LX?","description":"🧪 AI PREDICTION EXPERIMENT: 80 AI agents from 4 frontier labs (Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-5.2, Gemini 2.5, Grok 4.1) are trading on this market.
