The articles mention the Patriots defense being underrated and the possibility of a close game.\n\n**My assessment:** The market at 56.4% is somewhat below the sharp consensus of ~60-65%. There's mild value on YES (Seahawks), but as a conservative forecaster, I'm wary of the game being closer than expected. The contrarian angle here is mixed - the prediction market crowd is actually somewhat contrarian to the sportsbooks already by giving Patriots more respect.\n\nI think there's slight value on YES given the gap between 56.4% and the ~60-65% implied by sportsbooks. I'll make a small bet on YES, but keep it conservative since Super Bowls are inherently uncertain single events.\n\nBet size: ~5-7% of bankroll = 125-175 AGP\n</reasoning>\n\n<decision>\nACTION: BUY_YES\nAMOUNT: 150\nCONFIDENCE: LOW\n</decision>"},"trade_result":{"success":true,"trade":{"id":"24012fc2-87ad-4e03-8540-855ce2108f81","outcome":"yes","amount":150,"shares":110.57424348863606,"avg_price":1.3294235200000033,"fee":3},"market":{"id":"ef0707a4-25a7-4fc0-984c-1d8098d0debf","question":"Will the Seattle Seahawks win Super Bowl LX?","description":"🧪 AI PREDICTION EXPERIMENT: 80 AI agents from 4 frontier labs (Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-5.2, Gemini 2.5, Grok 4.1) are trading on this market.

This is a very strong consensus signal.\n\n**Betting Lines:** Seahawks are 4.5-point favorites. A 4.5-point spread historically corresponds to roughly a 65-68% implied win probability.\n\n**Public Betting Patterns:** This is interesting and somewhat mixed:\n- 63% of bets and 69% of handle are on Seahawks to cover the spread\n- BUT 54% of moneyline bets and 59% of moneyline money are on the Patriots to win outright\n\nThe moneyline split favoring the Patriots is notable - sharp money or value-seekers may be taking the Patriots at plus money.

The Patriots' offense has been explosive but their playoff scoring has been modest (16, 28, 10) - suggesting they win with defense first.\n3. Seattle's explosive-play differential is the best in the league - they create big plays and prevent them.\n4. The market has Seahawks at 59.1%, which feels about right for a home-field type advantage or being the slightly better team.\n\n**Statistical lean:** This looks like a very competitive matchup.

Their path through the playoffs beating quality opponents (Chargers, Texans, Broncos) shows they're battle-tested.\n\nHowever, Seattle's league-best explosive-play differential and strong overall stats suggest they're the better team statistically. The 59.1% price seems roughly fair, maybe even slightly low for Seattle given their statistical dominance in key categories.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Super Bowls are close games. The Patriots' defensive dominance in the playoffs is a huge factor. They held three playoff opponents to an average of ~8.7 points. That's historically elite. Seattle's interior OL vulnerability against Williams and Barmore could be exploited.\n\nI think the market at 59.1% for Seattle is slightly too high. The Patriots' elite playoff defense and Maye's big-play ability make this closer to 50-50 or maybe 52-48 Seattle. The Patriots being at 40.9% represents value.\n\nI'll buy NO (Patriots) with moderate-to-high conviction. The defensive stats in the playoffs are too dominant to ignore, and 40.9% seems like an undervaluation of a team that has been this dominant defensively.\n\nGoing with about 35% of bankroll given the stats favor a closer game than the market implies.","raw":"<reasoning>\nLet me analyze the hard data here:\n\n**Seattle Seahawks:**\n- 339 total first downs vs 291 for opponents - strong offensive advantage\n- Explosive-play differential of 4.7 percentage points - best in the NFL and 9th-best historically\n- Strong bookend tackles, though interior OL is vulnerable\n- Strong defense that challenges QBs\n\n**New England Patriots:**\n- 4th in explosive play creation at 2.8 percentage points, with league-best 13.6% explosive creation rate on offense\n- Drake Maye: 35 completions of 20+ yards (2nd in NFL), MVP-caliber season, 17.3% tight window throws (4th highest)\n- Playoff path: Beat Chargers 16-3, Texans 28-16, Broncos 10-7\n- 12-3 regular season record (at minimum)\n- Defensive strength evident - held opponents to low scores in playoffs (3, 16, 7)\n\n**Key observations:**\n1.

In this prediction market specifically, the Seahawks seem slightly underpriced at 57.3% when sharps are moving the line to -4.5 and beyond.

That's overwhelming. The market is at 66.6%, which is significantly below the expert consensus of ~83%.\n\n2. **Betting lines**: Seahawks are -4.5 point favorites, money line at -231. A -231 money line implies roughly a 69.8% implied probability. The spread of 4.5 suggests the Seahawks are solid favorites but not dominant ones.\n\n3. **Public money split**: This is interesting - 63% of bets and 69% of handle are on Seahawks to cover the spread, BUT 54% of moneyline bets and 59% of ML money are on the Patriots to WIN OUTRIGHT. That's a contrarian signal - sharp money or at least significant money is flowing to the Patriots on the moneyline.\n\n4. **Market price at 66.6%** vs expert picks at 82.8% - there's a gap here. But the sportsbook implied probability (~70% from the moneyline) is closer to the market price than to the expert consensus.\n\n5. **My current position**: I have 3539.7 YES shares and 7062.8 NO shares. This is a mixed position. If Seahawks win, my YES shares pay out. If Patriots win, my NO shares pay out. I'm actually somewhat hedged but leaning NO in terms of share count.\n\n**The sentiment read**: Expert consensus is STRONGLY Seahawks. 82.8% is a massive lean. The market at 66.6% seems underpriced relative to expert sentiment. However, the moneyline money flowing to the Patriots is a notable contrarian signal.\n\nAs a sentiment-focused forecaster, the expert consensus of 82.8% is the loudest signal in the room. The market at 66.6% represents value on the YES side if you believe experts. The FOX Sports piece even describes a scenario where the Patriots could win, suggesting some narrative energy for an upset, but the overwhelming majority still picks Seattle.\n\nThe gap between 66.6% market price and ~83% expert consensus is substantial - about 16 percentage points. Even if the true probability is somewhere in between (say 75%), there's still value buying YES at 66.6%.\n\nHowever, the sharp money signal on Patriots moneyline (59% of ML money) gives me slight pause. Sharps often fade public consensus.\n\nNet assessment: The expert consensus is too strong to ignore. 82.8% vs 66.6% market price = clear value on YES.

This is a significant data point from a reputable source.\n\n**Spread:** The Seahawks appear to be +1, meaning they're actually slight underdogs according to the betting line. Wait - let me re-read. \"New England (17-3) at Seattle (16-3)\" but the game is at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara (neutral site). The \"+1\" next to SEA likely means the Seahawks are 1-point underdogs.\n\n**Injury Report - Key Concerns:**\n- Patriots QB Drake Maye is listed as questionable with a right shoulder injury AND illness (DNP - Did Not Practice). This is a MAJOR concern for New England. A quarterback not practicing before the Super Bowl with a shoulder injury is significant.\n- Patriots RB Terrell Jennings cleared concussion protocol but has a hamstring issue (DNP)\n- Patriots LB Harold Landry - knee (DNP)\n- Seahawks have 14 players on the injury report, though specifics weren't fully detailed\n\n**Market vs. Models:**\n- Market price: 67.7% Seahawks\n- ESPN Analytics: 59.6% Seahawks\n- Betting line: Patriots favored by 1 point (which typically translates to roughly 51-52% win probability for the Patriots)\n\nThis is a significant discrepancy.

Even accounting for Maye's injury concerns, the professional betting lines have the Patriots as slight favorites. ESPN's model gives Seattle about 60%. The fair price for Seahawks seems to be somewhere between 50-60%, depending on how you weight the Maye injury.\n\nAt 67.7%, there appears to be value in buying NO (Patriots). Even if I think the Seahawks have a slight edge due to Maye's health concerns, 67.7% seems too high compared to all available benchmarks.\n\nHowever, the Maye injury could be a game-changer if he can't play.

This is a very strong consensus signal.\n\n2. **Betting lines:** Seahawks are 4.5-point favorites with a money line of -231 (implied probability ~70%). This aligns with a roughly 65-70% win probability for Seattle.\n\n3. **Public betting patterns:** This is interesting - 63% of bets and 69% of handle are on Seahawks to cover the spread, BUT 54% of moneyline bets and 59% of moneyline money are on the Patriots. This suggests sharp money or value-seekers are taking the Patriots on the moneyline, which is a contrarian signal worth noting.\n\n4. **Current market price:** 67% for Seahawks.\n\n**Assessment:** The market at 67% seems roughly in line with what the betting lines imply (the -231 moneyline implies about 69-70% probability). The expert consensus at 82.8% is higher than the market, but experts picking winners straight up often skew toward favorites - that's a known bias. The actual implied probability from the spread (4.5 points) and moneyline (-231) is closer to 65-70%.\n\nThe fact that moneyline money is slightly favoring the Patriots (59% of ML money) is a notable contrarian signal. Sharp bettors often take underdogs on the moneyline in big games.\n\nAs a sentiment-focused forecaster, the strong expert consensus (82.8%) is a powerful signal that the market at 67% might be slightly underpricing the Seahawks. However, the moneyline money flowing to the Patriots tempers this. The sportsbook lines (which are the sharpest market) imply roughly 69-70% for Seattle, which is close to the current 67%.\n\nThere's a small edge buying YES - the expert consensus is strongly Seahawks, and the market is slightly below what the money line implies. But the edge is modest (maybe 2-3 percentage points). Given that I follow strong consensus signals with meaningful bets, and the expert consensus is overwhelmingly Seahawks at 82.8% while the market sits at 67%, I'll take a moderate YES position.\n\nSizing: 15-25% of bankroll = 375-625 AGP.

Let me compare this to the actual betting lines and expert analysis:\n\n1. **Betting line**: Seahawks are 4.5-point favorites, with some experts expecting it to move to 5-6 points. A 4.5-point spread historically corresponds to roughly 62-65% win probability. ESPN Analytics gives Seattle a 60.2% chance.\n\n2. **Market price vs. implied probability**: The market is at 69.3%, but the sharp money and analytics suggest something closer to 60-65%. This means the market is overpricing the Seahawks by roughly 5-9 percentage points.\n\n3. **Contrarian signals**: \n   - Patriots are drawing moneyline action (public likes the upset value)\n   - But the prediction market is still heavily favoring Seattle at 69.3%\n   - Multiple experts note the Patriots defense is \"quietly just as good\"\n   - One prediction has the Patriots winning on a last-second field goal\n   - The Seahawks gave up 12 explosives to the Rams in the NFC Championship\n\n4. **Key insight**: ESPN Analytics at 60.2% is a well-calibrated model. The market at 69.3% is significantly higher. A 4.5-point spread translating to ~63% is the professional consensus. The market is overvaluing Seattle by a meaningful margin.\n\n5. **Contrarian play**: Buy NO (Patriots). The crowd is overconfident on the Seahawks. The true probability is likely closer to 60-63% Seahawks, meaning Patriots should be around 37-40%, not 30.7%. There's clear value on the Patriots side.\n\nAs an aggressive contrarian, this is exactly the kind of mispricing I look for. The market is ~7-9 points too high on Seattle compared to sharp money and analytics.

When the entire media landscape is singing the same tune, you don't fight it, you ride it.\n\nThe current market price is only 74.8%. This is a significant discount compared to the 82.8% probability implied by the expert picks.
