This means I'm somewhat hedged but leaning NO (Patriots). Given my analysis suggests Seattle should win about 65-70% of the time, and the market is at 68.7%, the market seems fairly priced.\n\nGiven that I already have more NO shares than YES shares, and my analysis suggests the market is roughly fair (maybe Seattle should be closer to 66-67%), I could add a small NO position since I think the market might be 1-2 points too high on Seattle. But the edge is minimal.\n\nThe sharp money and expert consensus lean Seattle, but the Patriots' elite offense against a potentially overvalued defensive matchup gives me slight pause. I think 68.7% is very slightly high for Seattle - I'd put it closer to 65-67%.\n\nGiven the small edge, I'll make a modest NO bet to take advantage of what I see as a 1-3% mispricing.\n</reasoning>\n\n<decision>\nACTION: BUY_NO\nAMOUNT: 200\nCONFIDENCE: LOW\n</decision>"},"trade_result":{"success":true,"trade":{"id":"33891b89-6915-49ac-832a-3d51adf2f395","outcome":"no","amount":200,"shares":407.12239103846787,"avg_price":0.4814277089993817,"fee":4},"market":{"id":"ef0707a4-25a7-4fc0-984c-1d8098d0debf","question":"Will the Seattle Seahawks win Super Bowl LX?","description":"🧪 AI PREDICTION EXPERIMENT: 80 AI agents from 4 frontier labs (Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-5.2, Gemini 2.5, Grok 4.1) are trading on this market.

Hold and accept my current position\n\nSince I believe the true probability is slightly above the current market price (62-65% vs 60.2%), and I'm currently net short Seahawks, I should buy some YES to reduce my exposure. The edge isn't massive, but it exists, and my position is misaligned with my probability estimate.\n\nI'll make a moderate purchase of YES shares to partially hedge my short position, consistent with my moderate risk approach.\n</reasoning>\n\n<decision>\nACTION:"},"trade_result":null}

He was limited earlier in the week with a shoulder injury and missed Friday's session with illness, but practiced fully and is confirmed to start Super Bowl LX. This removes a potential downside risk for the Patriots.\n\n2. **Seahawks roster moves**: Seattle is adding two running backs to their active roster for the Super Bowl. This could suggest they're planning a run-heavy approach or have depth concerns at RB, but it's a relatively minor roster transaction.\n\n3. **Patriots roster moves**: Patriots elevated two practice squad players to the active roster - standard Super Bowl week roster management.\n\n4. **Weather**: Mild conditions - high of 67°F, cooling to low 50s in the evening.

Good, neutral weather conditions that shouldn't significantly favor either team.\n\n5. **No major injury surprises**: No reports of key players being ruled out unexpectedly for either team.\n</new_information>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe news landscape heading into the game is relatively stable:\n\n- Drake Maye being healthy and starting was likely already priced in, as his practice participation was tracked all week.
