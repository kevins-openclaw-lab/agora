The starting QB being DNP on Friday before the Super Bowl with a shoulder injury is very concerning for the Patriots.\n- Patriots RB Terrell Jennings: Cleared concussion protocol but also has hamstring (DNP) - key offensive weapon questionable\n- Patriots LB Harold Landry III: Knee (DNP) - defensive starter\n- Patriots LB Robert Spillane: Ankle (Limited)\n- Seahawks have 14 players on injury report but no specifics about critical starters being out\n\n**Key Analysis:**\nThe Drake Maye shoulder injury is the most significant piece of news. A QB with a shoulder injury on his throwing arm, listed as DNP on Friday before the Super Bowl, is a major red flag. Even if he plays, his effectiveness could be significantly diminished. This alone should push the probability more toward Seattle.\n\nThe market at 57.7% seems to undervalue the Seahawks given:\n1. ESPN Analytics has them at 59.6%\n2. The Patriots have significant injury concerns, especially at QB\n3. Multiple key Patriots players were DNP on Friday\n4. The Seahawks are favored by +1 (Patriots are +1 underdogs based on the line shown)\n5. National media sentiment seems to favor the Seahawks\n\nThe Seahawks' true probability given these injury concerns is likely in the 60-65% range. The market at 57.7% offers some value on YES.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nWith my moderate approach and 15-25% bankroll sizing, I should bet around $375-625. Given that the edge isn't enormous (maybe 3-7 percentage points), I'll go with a moderate position. The injury news is concerning but players can still play through questionable designations, so there's uncertainty.\n\nI'll buy YES at around 20% of my bankroll (~500 AGP) with medium confidence.","raw":"<reasoning>\nLet me analyze the key information available:\n\n**Game Details:**\n- Super Bowl LX: Seattle Seahawks vs New England Patriots, February 8, 2026\n- Location: Levi's Stadium, Santa Clara, CA\n- Both teams are 14-3 (regular season), with Patriots listed as 17-3 and Seahawks 16-3 (including playoffs)\n\n**ESPN Analytics:**\n- ESPN gives Seahawks 59.6% win probability vs Patriots 40.4%\n- The market is at 57.7% for Seahawks, which is slightly below ESPN's model\n\n**Injury Report - Critical:**\n- Patriots QB Drake Maye: Right Shoulder / Illness (DNP) - This is HUGE.
