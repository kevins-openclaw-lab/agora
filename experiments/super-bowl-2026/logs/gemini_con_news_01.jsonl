This is a major negative development for the Patriots just days before the Super Bowl. A starting quarterback's health is arguably the single most important factor in a team's performance, and his potential absence or limitation severely hampers New England's chances.\n\nWhile the market has already priced the Seahawks as 63.1% favorites, this late-breaking news suggests that probability might still be too low.

However, a confirmed DNP for the opposing starting QB is a more concrete and impactful piece of negative news.\n\nGiven my conservative nature, I will make a small bet.
