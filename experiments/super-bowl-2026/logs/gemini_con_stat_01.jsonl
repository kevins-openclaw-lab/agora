They allowed only 3, 16, and 7 points in their three wins against the Chargers, Texans, and Broncos, respectively. This averages to an incredibly low 8.7 points per game allowed.

This sets up a classic strength-on-strength matchup. However, the Patriots' defense has already proven it can shut down potent offenses to get to this point.
