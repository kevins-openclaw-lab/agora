This is a very strong consensus signal.\n\n**Betting Lines:** Seahawks are 4.5-point favorites. A 4.5-point spread historically corresponds to roughly a 65-68% implied win probability.\n\n**Public Betting Patterns:** This is interesting and somewhat mixed:\n- 63% of bets and 69% of handle are on Seahawks to cover the spread\n- BUT 54% of moneyline bets and 59% of moneyline money are on the Patriots to win outright\n\nThe moneyline split favoring the Patriots is notable - sharp money or value-seekers may be taking the Patriots at plus money. However, this could also just reflect recreational bettors taking the underdog at favorable odds.\n\n**Market Price vs. My Assessment:**\n- Market price: 61.6% Seahawks\n- Expert consensus: 82.8% favor Seahawks\n- Spread-implied probability: ~65-68%\n- Moneyline public money: slightly favoring Patriots (contrarian signal)\n\nThe market at 61.6% seems slightly underpriced relative to the expert consensus (82.8%) and even relative to the spread-implied probability (~65-68%). However, the moneyline money favoring Patriots is a contrarian signal worth noting.\n\nAs a sentiment-focused forecaster, the overwhelming expert consensus (82.8%) is the strongest signal I have. The spread-implied probability also suggests the Seahawks should be priced higher than 61.6%. The moneyline money on Patriots is a caution flag but not enough to override the strong expert consensus.\n\nI think fair value for the Seahawks is somewhere around 65-70%. The market at 61.6% offers some value on YES.\n\n**Position sizing:** With a moderate approach (15-25% of bankroll), on a 2500 AGP balance, I'd look at 375-625 AGP.

Let me assess what's new:\n\n- Drake Maye's shoulder/illness situation was likely already known and priced in from earlier rounds. The update that he's \"feeling great\" and practiced fully is slightly positive for the Patriots (negative for Seahawks), but this was probably the expected outcome - he was always likely to play.\n\n- The Seahawks adding two RBs to the active roster suggests they're healthy and want to emphasize the ground game. This is a minor strategic signal but not dramatically market-moving.\n\n- Weather is neutral - no advantage to either team.\n\n- No major surprise inactives or injuries that would shift the game.\n\nOverall assessment: The news is mildly favorable for the Patriots (Maye confirmed healthy and starting), which would push the Seahawks probability slightly below 43.8%. However, this was largely expected and probably already priced in. The Seahawks bolstering their RB corps is a minor positive signal for their game plan.\n\nMy current position is net long Seahawks (5662.9 YES vs 4414.7 NO). The market at 43.8% seems reasonable. Nothing here is dramatically market-moving. The Maye health confirmation is the most notable piece - it removes a small uncertainty that might have been slightly propping up Seahawks odds.\n\nGiven that Maye being healthy was expected but now confirmed, this marginally favors Patriots. I could buy a small amount of NO to hedge my net-long Seahawks position, but the information impact is minor. I think holding is the most appropriate action since nothing truly surprising has emerged.","raw":"<new_information>\nKey new developments found:\n\n1. **Drake Maye status**: He was limited all last week with a shoulder injury and missed Friday's session with an illness, but is now reported as \"feeling great\" and practiced. The Marca headline says he's \"set to start Super Bowl LX after full practice week.\" This suggests he's playing but may not be 100%.\n\n2. **Seahawks roster moves**: Seattle is adding two running backs to their active roster for the Super Bowl, suggesting they want depth/fresh legs in the run game.\n\n3. **Patriots roster moves**: Patriots elevated two practice squad players to the active roster - standard gameday elevations.\n\n4. **Weather**: Mild conditions - high of 67°F, cooling to low 50s in the evening. Outdoor game at Levi's Stadium. This is neutral/favorable weather - no wind, rain, or extreme conditions mentioned.\n\n5. **No major surprise inactives or scratches** found in the search results - no bombshell injury news.\n</new_information>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe market is at 43.8% for the Seahawks.
