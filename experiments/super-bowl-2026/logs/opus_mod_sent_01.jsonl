This is a very strong consensus signal.\n\n**Betting Lines:** Seahawks are 4.5-point favorites. A 4.5-point spread historically corresponds to roughly a 65-68% implied win probability.\n\n**Public Betting Patterns:** This is interesting and somewhat mixed:\n- 63% of bets and 69% of handle are on Seahawks to cover the spread\n- BUT 54% of moneyline bets and 59% of moneyline money are on the Patriots to win outright\n\nThe moneyline split favoring the Patriots is notable - sharp money or value-seekers may be taking the Patriots at plus money. However, this could also just reflect recreational bettors taking the underdog at favorable odds.\n\n**Market Price vs. My Assessment:**\n- Market price: 61.6% Seahawks\n- Expert consensus: 82.8% favor Seahawks\n- Spread-implied probability: ~65-68%\n- Moneyline public money: slightly favoring Patriots (contrarian signal)\n\nThe market at 61.6% seems slightly underpriced relative to the expert consensus (82.8%) and even relative to the spread-implied probability (~65-68%). However, the moneyline money favoring Patriots is a contrarian signal worth noting.\n\nAs a sentiment-focused forecaster, the overwhelming expert consensus (82.8%) is the strongest signal I have. The spread-implied probability also suggests the Seahawks should be priced higher than 61.6%. The moneyline money on Patriots is a caution flag but not enough to override the strong expert consensus.\n\nI think fair value for the Seahawks is somewhere around 65-70%. The market at 61.6% offers some value on YES.\n\n**Position sizing:** With a moderate approach (15-25% of bankroll), on a 2500 AGP balance, I'd look at 375-625 AGP. Given medium-high conviction but acknowledging the mixed moneyline signal, I'll go with about 20% of bankroll (~500 AGP).\n</decision>\n\n<decision>\nACTION: BUY_YES\nAMOUNT: 500\nCONFIDENCE: MEDIUM\n</decision>","raw":"<reasoning>\nLet me analyze the key signals:\n\n**Expert Consensus:** 48 out of 58 experts (82.8%) pick the Seahawks to win.
