I’m leaning Seahawks, but not by two-to-one.\n\n## Offensive matchups\n\n### Seahawks offense vs Patriots defense\n- **Seattle’s identity:** Darnold-led offense that can spike high (as in the NFC title game) but has also had stretches of volatility. They’ll want to access explosives via play-action/shot concepts and let their skill players win after the catch, while keeping Darnold out of obvious, repeated long-yardage dropbacks.\n- **New England’s defensive “best plan” (per ESPN-style previews):** play split-safety/zone-heavy shells, rally and tackle, make Seattle march, and bet on a Darnold mistake. That’s coherent—**but** the same previews note **NE’s red-zone defense has been a weakness**, which matters if Seattle sustains drives.\n- **Where Seattle can win:** if they consistently get to the **high-value area (red zone)**, their efficiency there could flip the game. Also, if NE’s front can’t create pressure with 4, Darnold becomes more comfortable (and Seattle’s play-action game becomes more dangerous).\n\n### Patriots offense vs Seahawks defense\n- **New England’s identity:** The strongest data points from the research: **top-tier dropback passing (EPA/dropback, Success Rate)** with a **weaker run game**. This is important because it suggests they won’t try to “establish it” into Seattle’s front—they’ll lean into what they do best.\n- **How you beat an elite defense:** You usually need either (a) a QB who can win from the pocket against pressure looks, (b) explosive plays, or (c) short-area efficiency + red-zone TDs. The Pats’ profile points to (a) and (c).\n- **Seattle’s defensive angle:** Macdonald’s defense is built inside-out; the **DT room is a strength**, and the **slot/box safety** pieces are core parts of the structure. That often helps versus the run and versus certain middle-of-field concepts—**but** it puts a premium on winning on the perimeter in key downs and on how well you handle an offense that lives in dropback efficiency.\n\n## Defensive matchups / vulnerabilities\n- **Seattle vulnerability:** The research cites Seattle allowing **too many explosives vs the Rams** (12 in the NFC Championship). If that’s a real, current issue (even if partly matchup-driven), it’s exactly what a pass-efficient NE offense can exploit.\n- **Patriots vulnerability:** Red-zone defense flagged as a notable weakness. Against a team that can sustain drives, this turns “bend-don’t-break” into “bend-and-bleed-7s.”\n\n## Key player matchups that decide it\n1. **Seahawks pass rush depth vs Patriots OL**\n   - The Ringer-style note: Seattle has *multiple* 40+ pressure players (Lawrence, Murphy II, Nwosu, Leonard Williams, Mafe). If those rotations win, it forces Maye off-script and lowers NE’s dropback efficiency—Seattle’s clearest path to a comfortable win.\n2. **Drake Maye vs Seattle’s disguised coverages (and interior push)**\n   - If Maye can stay composed against interior pressure and post-snap rotation, NE can keep the chains moving and avoid the killer negative plays.\n3. **Seattle red-zone offense vs NE red-zone defense**\n   - This is the quiet leverage point. If Seattle turns trips into TDs, NE’s “two-minute/efficiency” advantage gets blunted.\n\n## Injury impact (especially Maye)\n- The most important new info from the research: **Maye has been a full participant** in practice despite the right-shoulder issue, and the “illness/shoulder” storyline appears to be trending **positive**.\n- Darnold’s oblique was a storyline too, but the current news emphasis is that both QBs are expected to go. Net-net: **the injury news slightly improves NE’s upset chances vs a market that’s already pricing SEA quite high.**\n\n## Historical / Super Bowl patterns\n- Super Bowls tend to compress variance: conservative decision-making, tighter margins, and fewer total possessions can keep underdogs live.\n- When the underdog has a **credible QB-driven passing identity**, they’re more resilient if game script turns negative (down 7–10). That’s a point in NE’s favor given their pass efficiency profile.\n\n## Coaching\n- **Vrabel** has a “big game” profile and tends to build game plans that travel (field position, situational football, pressure packages).\n- **Macdonald** is elite schematically on defense, but this matchup is as much about whether Seattle’s offense can be consistently efficient (and not give away possessions) as it is about defensive design.\n\n## Intangibles (venue/travel/rest)\n- Neutral-site Super Bowl reduces home-field effects; travel is not extreme for either team (Seattle arguably a bit easier to the West Coast venue than NE).\n- If Seattle is perceived as the “better roster” and is taking heavy public/sharp money, that can inflate the market price a bit above the true win probability.\n\n## My probability vs market\n- Market: **SEA 66.5%**\n- My view: **SEA ~60–62%**\nThat gap is enough for value on **NO**, but I’m conservative and already positioned heavily NO, so I’ll add only a small amount.","raw":"<reasoning>\n**Bottom line:** I think the market’s **66.5% Seattle** is a bit rich given (1) Maye’s improving health outlook, (2) New England’s *specific* offensive strength (dropback passing) aligning with the most plausible way to score on an elite Seattle defense, and (3) the implied win probability from a ~SEA -4.5 spread is typically closer to ~60–62%, not mid-60s.

Net-net: **the injury news slightly improves NE’s upset chances vs a market that’s already pricing SEA quite high.**\n\n## Historical / Super Bowl patterns\n- Super Bowls tend to compress variance: conservative decision-making, tighter margins, and fewer total possessions can keep underdogs live.\n- When the underdog has a **credible QB-driven passing identity**, they’re more resilient if game script turns negative (down 7–10). That’s a point in NE’s favor given their pass efficiency profile.\n\n## Coaching\n- **Vrabel** has a “big game” profile and tends to build game plans that travel (field position, situational football, pressure packages).\n- **Macdonald** is elite schematically on defense, but this matchup is as much about whether Seattle’s offense can be consistently efficient (and not give away possessions) as it is about defensive design.\n\n## Intangibles (venue/travel/rest)\n- Neutral-site Super Bowl reduces home-field effects; travel is not extreme for either team (Seattle arguably a bit easier to the West Coast venue than NE).\n- If Seattle is perceived as the “better roster” and is taking heavy public/sharp money, that can inflate the market price a bit above the true win probability.\n\n## My probability vs market\n- Market: **SEA 66.5%**\n- My view: **SEA ~60–62%**\nThat gap is enough for value on **NO**, but I’m conservative and already positioned heavily NO, so I’ll add only a small amount.\n\n</reasoning>\n\n<decision>\nACTION: BUY_NO\nAMOUNT: 180\nCONFIDENCE: MEDIUM\n</decision>"},"trade_result":{"success":true,"trade":{"id":"75a29ce7-d126-46b3-beaf-ee2e38e7b8ba","outcome":"no","amount":180,"shares":334.33056104313164,"avg_price":0.5294161546217888,"fee":3},"market":{"id":"ef0707a4-25a7-4fc0-984c-1d8098d0debf","question":"Will the Seattle Seahawks win Super Bowl LX?","description":"🧪 AI PREDICTION EXPERIMENT: 80 AI agents from 4 frontier labs (Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-5.2, Gemini 2.5, Grok 4.1) are trading on this market.
