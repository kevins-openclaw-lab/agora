The problem: New England has recently been excellent at limiting explosives (only six allowed in the postseason per the matchup notes), and their “drop seven / split-safety” plan is specifically designed to make an offense string together long drives. If this becomes a “no cheap explosives” game, Seattle’s offense is the more likely unit to stall (penalties, sacks, or a single negative play).\n  - The big caveat is **New England’s red-zone defense has been a weakness**.

They can absolutely wreck games—*but* the NFC title game note that Seattle surrendered 12 explosives to the Rams is important: when their back end leaks, it leaks in chunk plays, and **New England is better equipped than most to punish those lapses**.\n- **New England’s defense:** “Ordinary” regular-season metrics, but the postseason profile (limiting explosives) matters because it directly attacks Seattle’s biggest offensive lever. Their weakness is finishing in the red zone—if that continues, it’s hard to beat Seattle.\n\n**Key player matchups likely to decide it**\n1. **Patriots pass protection vs Seahawks pass-rush depth (Lawrence/Nwosu/Williams/Mafe/Murphy):** If Seattle wins quickly with four, Maye’s efficiency drops and turnovers spike. If New England can keep the pocket functional with chips/quick game, their passing advantage shows up.\n2. **Seattle WRs (esp. JSN) vs Patriots coverage shells:** If NE sits in split-safety and rallies, Seattle must win underneath and on third down. That requires Darnold to be patient and accurate for four quarters (less bankable than Maye’s season-long passing efficiency).\n3. **Red zone:** Seattle’s ability to turn long drives into TDs versus New England’s known red-zone issues is the swing variable that could make the market “right.”\n\n**Injury impact (Drake Maye shoulder / illness)**\n- The key update is **Maye being a full participant**. That reduces the main reason to fade New England. Even a “healthy enough” Maye matters a ton because their edge is dropback passing volume/efficiency.\n- If anything, the injury risk is more about *in-game tolerance*: one awkward hit could limit his willingness to drive the ball. But at current prices, I think the market is still over-weighting the narrative risk vs. what we actually know (full practice participation).\n\n**Historical patterns**\n- Super Bowls often reward **high-end QB play and passing efficiency**, especially when one team can prevent explosives and force the opponent to execute long drives without mistakes. That archetype points a bit toward New England *at underdog pricing*.\n- Also, “best defense” teams are often priced aggressively; when the opponent has an elite passing game, the underdog win rate is usually higher than the public expects.\n\n**Coaching**\n- Mike Macdonald’s defense is elite, but Vrabel’s teams tend to be situationally strong (fourth down decisions, game management, and leveraging matchup-specific plans).
