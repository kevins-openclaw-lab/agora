Bull case for New England: (1) Elite passing offense (1st in EPA/dropback, 2nd Pass DVOA, 3rd overall DVOA) perfectly counters Seahawks' defense, which allowed 12 explosives to the Rams and faces a healthy Drake Maye (shoulder fully cleared, full practice participant) who can exploit Seattle's red-zone vulnerabilities. (2) Patriots playoff defense has been lights-out (just 6 explosives allowed in 3 games vs. injured offenses), primed to force mistakes from an injury-nagged Darnold (oblique) who's been middling for two months outside one fluke game. (3) Sharp money on Pats ML (+190/+195) despite stagnant spread, signaling value vs. public/algos piling on SEA -4.5; Vegas pros (billions at stake) see it as a coin-flip closer to 50/50 than 62/38. (4) No model correlation blind spots—Pats are 10th FPI overall, 11th defense, with depth in key matchups (e.g., Pats OL doesn't need perfection vs. SEA pass rush). Crowd wrong on overconfidence in SEA narrative; Pats reached SB for a reason, and conservative schemes (7-man coverage, force runs) win low-scoring grinder.\n</contrarian_case>\n\n<reasoning>\nSolid contrarian case—Vegas odds (~65% SEA) align closely with market (62%), but sharp ML action on Pats +190 and playoff defensive surge suggest mild overshoot from AI cascade/herd bias.
