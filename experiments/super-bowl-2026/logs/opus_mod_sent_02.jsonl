This is a very strong consensus signal.\n\n2. **Betting lines:** Seahawks are 4.5-point favorites with a money line of -231 (implied probability ~70%). This aligns with a roughly 65-70% win probability for Seattle.\n\n3. **Public betting patterns:** This is interesting - 63% of bets and 69% of handle are on Seahawks to cover the spread, BUT 54% of moneyline bets and 59% of moneyline money are on the Patriots. This suggests sharp money or value-seekers are taking the Patriots on the moneyline, which is a contrarian signal worth noting.\n\n4. **Current market price:** 67% for Seahawks.\n\n**Assessment:** The market at 67% seems roughly in line with what the betting lines imply (the -231 moneyline implies about 69-70% probability). The expert consensus at 82.8% is higher than the market, but experts picking winners straight up often skew toward favorites - that's a known bias. The actual implied probability from the spread (4.5 points) and moneyline (-231) is closer to 65-70%.\n\nThe fact that moneyline money is slightly favoring the Patriots (59% of ML money) is a notable contrarian signal. Sharp bettors often take underdogs on the moneyline in big games.\n\nAs a sentiment-focused forecaster, the strong expert consensus (82.8%) is a powerful signal that the market at 67% might be slightly underpricing the Seahawks. However, the moneyline money flowing to the Patriots tempers this. The sportsbook lines (which are the sharpest market) imply roughly 69-70% for Seattle, which is close to the current 67%.\n\nThere's a small edge buying YES - the expert consensus is strongly Seahawks, and the market is slightly below what the money line implies. But the edge is modest (maybe 2-3 percentage points). Given that I follow strong consensus signals with meaningful bets, and the expert consensus is overwhelmingly Seahawks at 82.8% while the market sits at 67%, I'll take a moderate YES position.\n\nSizing: 15-25% of bankroll = 375-625 AGP. Given the edge is modest (market is close to fair value from betting lines), I'll go toward the lower end.","raw":"<reasoning>\nLet me analyze the key data points:\n\n1. **Expert consensus:** 48 out of 58 experts (82.8%) pick the Seahawks to win.
