Super Bowl LX in February 2026 is beyond what I can confidently assess with specific roster/season knowledge.\n\n**What I know generally:**\n\n**Seattle Seahawks:** After the Russell Wilson trade, the Seahawks were in a rebuilding phase. Geno Smith took over as QB. They had some promising young talent, particularly on defense. Mike Macdonald was hired as head coach (from Baltimore's defensive coordinator). They've been a team in transition.\n\n**New England Patriots:** Post-Tom Brady, the Patriots have been struggling significantly. They had one of the worst records in recent years. Drake Maye was drafted as their young QB. Jerod Mayo was hired as coach (then fired after one season), and Mike Vrabel was brought in. They've been in a deep rebuild.\n\n**The matchup context:** Both teams making the Super Bowl would represent significant turnarounds. This is a game that hasn't happened yet and is outside normal prediction windows.\n\n**Market price analysis:** At 50.8%, the market is essentially calling this a coin flip, which makes sense for a Super Bowl matchup where both teams have made it to the championship. Super Bowls are generally close to 50/50 by nature, though one team usually has a slight edge.\n\n**My assessment:** Without specific 2025 season data, I don't have a strong lean either way.

In general, Super Bowl lines rarely deviate far from pick'em territory.\n\n**My position:** I already hold a roughly balanced position (4919 YES, 5081 NO), which is close to hedged. The market is near 50/50.\n\nGiven that I have no strong information edge in a blind round, and the market is essentially at 50/50, the smartest move as a moderate trader is to hold.

The sentiment is too strong for me to be this heavily short. A moderate hedge makes sense — buying some YES to bring my position closer to neutral while still maintaining some NO exposure for the upset scenario.\n\nI'll buy a moderate amount of YES shares to partially hedge my net short position, following the strong sentiment signals."},"trade_result":null}

This suggests he's playing but may not be 100%.\n\n2. **Seahawks roster moves**: Seattle is adding two running backs to their active roster for the Super Bowl - this suggests they're bolstering their ground game, possibly indicating a game plan emphasis on running.\n\n3. **Patriots roster moves**: Patriots elevated two practice squad players to the active roster - standard pre-game elevation, nothing unusual.\n\n4. **Weather**: Mild conditions - 67°F high, cooling to low 50s in the evening. Outdoor game at Levi's Stadium. Good conditions, shouldn't significantly favor either team.\n\n5. **No major surprise inactives or scratches** found in the search results - no bombshell injury news.\n</new_information>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe market is at 51.9% Seahawks, essentially a coin flip with a very slight lean toward Seattle.\n\nAnalyzing the new info:\n- Drake Maye's shoulder/illness situation is somewhat concerning for the Patriots.
