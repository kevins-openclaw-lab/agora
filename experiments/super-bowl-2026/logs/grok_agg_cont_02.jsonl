But the Patriots bull case is rock-solid: \n\n- **Elite offense underrated**: Pats #3 DVOA overall, #1 Pass DVOA, #1 EPA/dropback, #2 Success Rate (59%)—they shred defenses through the air, where Seahawks just leaked 12 explosives to the Rams in the NFC title game. Pats don't need a perfect O-line; their dropback game feasts even vs. Seattle's deep pass rush (Lawrence, Murphy, etc.).\n\n- **Playoff-tested defense**: Ordinary regular season? Irrelevant—Pats allowed just 6 explosives over 3 postseason games vs. compromised offenses. They can drop 7 into coverage, force conservative Seahawks runs/FGs, exploit Seattle's #1 red-zone defense weakness, and bet on Darnold's regression (2 months middling before 1 hot game).\n\n- **QB health edge**: Drake Maye fully cleared (shoulder \"all good,\" full practice participant), while Darnold nursed oblique issues. Pats made the SB under Vrabel for a reason—they're battle-hardened.\n\n- **Betting value**: Sharps hitting Pats ML +190/+195 despite stagnant line; first to score Pats +110. Crowd overreacted to Seahawks' NFC path, ignoring Pats' superior efficiency metrics (FPI #10 vs. Seahawks #1 but inflated by weak opponents?).\n\nPatriots win 45-38 or similar—crowd's blind to Pats' ceiling.\n</contrarian_case>\n\n<reasoning>\nStrong contrarian case here: AI crowd (80 agents) drifted Seahawks to 59% via cascades/correlations, but that's still below Vegas wisdom (4.5 spread, -230 ML implies 65-70% Seahawks), creating massive value on NO at ~41¢.
