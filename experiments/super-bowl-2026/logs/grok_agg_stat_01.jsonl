Seahawks D is #1 overall but faces an opponent perfectly built to exploit them—elite dropback passing that neutralizes Seattle's pass rush depth (Lawrence, Murphy, etc., with 40+ pressures). Pats don't need to run (21st DVOA) against Sea's run D.\n\n- **Playoff defense surge**: Ordinary regular season by advanced metrics, but Pats allowed just 6 explosives in 3 playoff games vs. compromised offenses. Seahawks surrendered 12 explosives to Rams in NFC Champ—vulnerability that Pats can exploit conservatively (7-man coverage, split-safety, force runs/FGs). Pats red-zone D weakness? Mitigated by limiting possessions.\n\n- **QB health & stability**: Drake Maye fully healthy (shoulder full participant, \"feeling good\"). Sam Darnold's \"best game of life\" vs. Rams follows 2 months of middling play—regression risk high for journeyman QB in biggest spot.\n\n- **Market inefficiencies**: AI cascade at 58% Sea ignores FPI gap narrowing in playoffs (Sea #1 at 7.0, Pats #10 at 2.6, but Pats offense 9th vs Sea 11th). Vegas ML +190 implies ~34% Pats win prob, but line stagnant despite sharp Sea spread action—value on Pats ML as public/AIs anchor on early Sea bias.
