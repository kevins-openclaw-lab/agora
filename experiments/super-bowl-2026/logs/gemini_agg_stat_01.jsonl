Patriots: Linebacker Robert Spillane (ankle) did not practice on Wednesday due to an ankle injury. However, he did tell the Boston Herald earlier in the day that he&#x27;s &quot;100% confident&quot; that he&#x27;ll be able to play in Super Bowl LX. Meanwhile, linebacker Harold Landry (knee) and offensive tackle Thayer Munford Jr. were both limited with knee injuries. Maybe the most important development on the injury front for New England comes at quarterback as the team listed Drake Maye (right shoulder) as a full participant.","url":"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/super-bowl-lx-injury-report-updates-on-drake-mayes-right-shoulder-sam-darnolds-oblique-more/"}]}],"decision":{"action":"BUY_NO","amount":830,"confidence":"HIGH","reasoning":"The data is clear. The single biggest variable that could have swung the game in Seattle's favor was the health of the Patriots' starting quarterback. Drake Maye being confirmed at full strength is a major development that solidifies New England's position as the heavy favorite. Any lingering percentage points in the market that were accounting for a potential injury discount for the Patriots should now be eliminated. This is a significant positive for New England.\n\nFurthermore, the minor news that key Seahawks players on the offensive line (Cross) and in the secondary (Emmanwori) are banged up, even if they are playing, is a statistical negative for Seattle. These factors combined mean the already-low probability of a Seahawks win has decreased further based on this last-minute news. The market price of 14.8% for Seattle may now be too high. My aggressive, data-focused strategy dictates that when the facts change this clearly, I must change my position. I am heavily invested in a Seahawks win, and this news is unequivocally negative for that outcome. I need to hedge this position aggressively.","raw":"<new_information>\nThe most significant piece of new information is the final injury report confirming that New England Patriots QB Drake Maye was a full participant in practice and is \"feeling great\" for the Super Bowl.
