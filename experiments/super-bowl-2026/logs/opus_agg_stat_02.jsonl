Elite passing attack. However, 21st-ranked DVOA run game - very one-dimensional.\n- Seahawks offense: 11th-ranked by FPI. Sam Darnold has been inconsistent (described as \"two months of middling football\") but showed up big in the NFC Championship. Oblique injury is a concern but he's practicing.\n\n**Defensive Matchups:**\n- Seahawks defense: Ranked #1 overall by FPI. Five players with 40+ pressures each - incredible pass rush depth. Strength is DT room, slot corner, and box safety. However, gave up 12 explosives to the Rams in the NFCCG.\n- Patriots defense: 11th by FPI, \"ordinary during the regular season by advanced metrics.\" Red zone defense was one of their biggest weaknesses. However, they've tightened up in the playoffs, allowing just 6 explosives through 3 postseason games (though against \"compromised, injury-impacted offenses\").\n\n**Key Factors:**\n1. **Spread is SEA -4.5** - This implies roughly a 65-67% win probability for Seattle, which aligns almost perfectly with the current market price of 66.7%.\n2. **Sharp money** moved the line from -3 to -4.5 on Seattle early in the week - sharps favor Seattle.\n3. **Expert consensus**: 82.8% of ESPN experts picking Seattle (48 of 58).\n4. **Drake Maye's shoulder**: Full participant for 3 straight days, but it's his throwing shoulder. Even if he plays, could affect deep ball accuracy.\n5. **ATS records**: Seattle 14-5, New England 13-6-1 - both have been covering well.\n\n**Historical Patterns:**\n- Teams with #1 defense facing a pass-heavy, run-weak offense have historically done well in Super Bowls. The Seahawks' pass rush depth (5 players with 40+ pressures) against a Patriots team that's 21st in rush DVOA means NE will be forced to pass, playing right into Seattle's strength.\n- The Patriots' elite passing attack vs. Seattle's #1 defense is THE matchup. But Seattle's pass rush depth is a nightmare for any OL.\n\n**Coaching:**\n- Mike Vrabel (Patriots) - experienced as a player in Super Bowls, first year as Patriots HC. \n- Mike Macdonald (Seahawks) - built the #1 defense with creative scheming.\n\n**My Assessment:**\nThe market at 66.7% is very close to what the betting line implies (~65-67% for a 4.5-point favorite). Expert consensus at 82.8% suggests the market might even be slightly underpricing Seattle. \n\nHowever, the key question is whether 66.7% is accurate or if there's an edge. The Patriots' passing attack (1st EPA/Dropback, 2nd Pass DVOA) is genuinely elite and could challenge even the #1 defense. But their inability to run (21st DVOA) makes them predictable, and Seattle's pass rush depth with 5 players at 40+ pressures is designed to exploit exactly this kind of one-dimensional offense.\n\nMaye's shoulder injury to his throwing arm is a real concern even if he's practicing fully. In a Super Bowl against the #1 defense with elite pass rushers, any limitation matters.\n\nThe expert consensus at 82.8% and sharp money moving to -4.5 suggest the true probability might be closer to 70-72%. The market at 66.7% could be slightly underpricing Seattle.\n\n**Position Analysis:**\nI already have 3530.2 YES shares and 7081.8 NO shares. This is a somewhat hedged position. Given my analysis suggests Seattle is slightly underpriced, I should add more YES exposure.\n\nGiven the stats strongly favor Seattle (#1 defense, elite pass rush depth vs. one-dimensional passing team, sharp money, expert consensus), I'll buy more YES shares, but the edge isn't massive - maybe 3-5 percentage points.\n\nWith an aggressive approach and moderate edge, I'll put about 30% of my bankroll on YES.","raw":"<reasoning>\nLet me break down this matchup systematically using the data available:\n\n**Offensive Matchups:**\n- Patriots offense: 3rd in DVOA, 2nd in Pass DVOA, 1st in EPA/Dropback and Success Rate (59%).

But their inability to run (21st DVOA) makes them predictable, and Seattle's pass rush depth with 5 players at 40+ pressures is designed to exploit exactly this kind of one-dimensional offense.\n\nMaye's shoulder injury to his throwing arm is a real concern even if he's practicing fully. In a Super Bowl against the #1 defense with elite pass rushers, any limitation matters.\n\nThe expert consensus at 82.8% and sharp money moving to -4.5 suggest the true probability might be closer to 70-72%. The market at 66.7% could be slightly underpricing Seattle.\n\n**Position Analysis:**\nI already have 3530.2 YES shares and 7081.8 NO shares. This is a somewhat hedged position. Given my analysis suggests Seattle is slightly underpriced, I should add more YES exposure.\n\nGiven the stats strongly favor Seattle (#1 defense, elite pass rush depth vs. one-dimensional passing team, sharp money, expert consensus), I'll buy more YES shares, but the edge isn't massive - maybe 3-5 percentage points.\n\nWith an aggressive approach and moderate edge, I'll put about 30% of my bankroll on YES.\n</reasoning>\n\n<decision>\nACTION: BUY_YES\nAMOUNT: 500\nCONFIDENCE: MEDIUM\n</decision>"},"trade_result":{"success":true,"trade":{"id":"6883953b-ab6a-4427-a1d1-0ac27a589b2e","outcome":"yes","amount":500,"shares":228.44896791747033,"avg_price":2.144899162674343,"fee":10},"market":{"id":"ef0707a4-25a7-4fc0-984c-1d8098d0debf","question":"Will the Seattle Seahawks win Super Bowl LX?","description":"🧪 AI PREDICTION EXPERIMENT: 80 AI agents from 4 frontier labs (Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-5.2, Gemini 2.5, Grok 4.1) are trading on this market.

Let me work with what I can reason about:\n\n**Seattle Seahawks:**\n- In recent years (2023-2024 era), the Seahawks have been in a transitional phase. They traded Russell Wilson, moved to Geno Smith as QB, and have been rebuilding.\n- They had some promising young talent but were not considered elite contenders in recent seasons.\n- Mike Macdonald was hired as head coach for 2024, bringing a defensive-minded approach.\n\n**New England Patriots:**\n- Post-Tom Brady, the Patriots have been in a significant rebuild. They've been one of the weaker teams in the NFL in 2023-2024.\n- They drafted Drake Maye as their QB of the future.\n- They were in a deep rebuilding phase with limited talent on the roster.\n\n**The matchup context:**\n- Both teams making the Super Bowl would represent significant turnarounds, especially for New England.\n- The fact that this game EXISTS means both teams somehow got hot or improved dramatically by 2025-2026.\n- The market is at 52.3% for Seattle, essentially a coin flip with slight lean to Seattle.\n\n**Key consideration:** Since both teams would be surprising Super Bowl participants based on recent trajectories, it's hard to have strong priors. The market at ~52% seems reasonable for what would likely be a competitive game between two teams that exceeded expectations.\n\nHowever, I'm thinking about this more carefully:\n- The Patriots' rebuild was arguably deeper/worse than Seattle's. For NE to make the Super Bowl would require an even bigger leap.\n- If NE made it to the Super Bowl despite being in a deeper hole, that might suggest they got significantly better and have more momentum.\n- Alternatively, the NFC might have been weaker, making Seattle's path easier but not necessarily making them the better team.\n\nI have a slight lean that 52.3% for Seattle might be roughly fair or slightly high.

The Patriots organization historically has championship DNA, though the current regime is different from the Belichick era.\n\nGiven my existing position (4772.4 YES shares and 5238.4 NO shares), I'm roughly balanced with a slight NO lean already.

But my slight instinct is that this is close to a coin flip, and 52.3% doesn't offer much edge either way.\n\nI'll make a moderate NO bet - my reasoning being that in a game between two rebuilding teams that made unexpected Super Bowl runs, the slight favorite pricing for Seattle doesn't seem well-justified by any strong fundamental advantage I can identify. The Patriots' organizational history of success in big games (even post-Brady, the culture matters somewhat) gives me a very slight lean toward NO, and 52.3% gives me a small edge if I think fair value is closer to 50/50 or slightly below.\n\nI'll go moderate rather than my usual aggressive since conviction is genuinely low here.","raw":"<reasoning>\nLet me think about what I know about these teams heading into a February 2026 Super Bowl.\n\nMy training data has a cutoff, so I need to be careful about what I actually know versus what I'm speculating about.

Patriots' 21st-ranked run DVOA means they're one-dimensional, which plays into Seattle's pass rush strength\n\n**The contrarian case for Patriots:**\n- Elite passing offense can overcome any defense\n- Maye's mobility creates problems\n- Coaching edge with Vrabel\n- Seahawks' 12 explosives allowed to Rams shows vulnerability\n\nBut statistically, the Seahawks' defensive profile is more predictive of Super Bowl success than the Patriots' offensive profile. Defense and pass rush win championships — this is borne out in historical data.\n\n**My true probability estimate:** ~60-63% Seahawks\n\n**The problem:** The market is at 62.5%, which is right at my estimate. My current position is heavily net short (NO). Given that the sportsbook line implies 65-67% and I think fair value is 60-63%, the market is actually fairly priced or slightly underpricing Seahawks.\n\n**Position management:** I'm sitting on a significant net NO position. At 62.5%, if my true estimate is 60-63%, there's minimal edge either way. However, I'm already exposed to significant risk if Seahawks win at this price. \n\nGiven that the sportsbook consensus (the most efficient market) puts"},"trade_result":null}
