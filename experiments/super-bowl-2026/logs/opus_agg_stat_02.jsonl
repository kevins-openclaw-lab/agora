When Maye has time, he can be extremely dangerous. One of the keys to his MVP-caliber season has been a willingness to make high-degree-of-difficulty throws. Overall, 17.3 percent of Maye’s attempts have been into tight windows—that’s the fourth-highest rate among starting quarterbacks. The Seahawks defense will challenge him.","url":"https://www.theringer.com/2026/02/02/nfl/super-bowl-60-cheat-sheet-22-things-to-know-about-patriots-vs-seahawks-drake-maye-sam-darnold"},{"title":"Super Bowl 2026: 60 facts to know for Seahawks vs. Patriots - CBS Sports","snippet":"Seattle has strong bookend tackles, but the interior offensive line is gettable, meaning Williams and Christian Barmore could have chances. 47.

The Patriots' playoff wins show a pattern: they won their Conference Championship 10-7 against Denver. That's an extremely low-scoring, grind-it-out win. Their Wild Card was 16-3. Only the Divisional (28-16) showed offensive firepower.\n2. Seattle's explosive play differential being the best in the NFL is a massive statistical indicator. They create more big plays and prevent them better than anyone.\n3. The market has Seahawks at 61.7%. In a Super Bowl, home field doesn't matter (neutral site). \n\n**Historical context:** Super Bowls are often close, and the \"better\" team wins roughly 55-65% of the time. The market at 61.7% for Seattle seems reasonable but possibly slightly low given:\n- Seattle's league-best explosive play differential\n- Seattle's superior first down production (339 vs opponents' 291)\n- New England's tendency toward low-scoring games in the playoffs (10-7 conference championship)\n\nHowever, the Patriots have shown they can win ugly and their defense is clearly elite. Maye is a dynamic playmaker. The 61.7% price seems roughly fair - maybe slightly undervaluing Seattle given their statistical dominance in key categories.\n\nThe explosive play differential is the stat that jumps out most. That 4.7% differential being the best in the NFL is a strong predictor. Teams that dominate this metric tend to win big games. Seattle also had more first downs (339 to opponents' 291), suggesting sustained offensive drives.\n\nNew England's playoff path shows a team that wins with defense - 16-3, 28-16, 10-7. Against Seattle's explosive offense, they may struggle to keep up if they can't generate their own explosive plays consistently.\n\nI think Seattle's true probability is around 63-66%. The market at 61.7% offers a small edge on the YES side. Given my aggressive profile, I'll take a moderate-to-large position on YES, but the edge isn't enormous - maybe 2-4 percentage points.\n\nWith a 2500 AGP balance and my aggressive style, I'll put about 30-35% on YES given the modest edge.","raw":"<reasoning>\nLet me analyze the hard data here:\n\n**Seattle Seahawks:**\n- 339 total first downs vs 291 for opponents - strong offensive production\n- Explosive-play differential of 4.7 percentage points - best in the NFL and 9th-best ever\n- Strong bookend tackles, though interior OL is vulnerable\n- Defense that challenges QBs and limits big plays\n\n**New England Patriots:**\n- 4th in explosive play creation at 2.8 percentage points\n- League-best explosive creation rate of 13.6% on offense\n- Drake Maye: 35 completions of 20+ yards (2nd in NFL), 17.3% into tight windows (4th highest)\n- Playoff path: Beat Chargers 16-3, Texans 28-16, Broncos 10-7\n- 12-3 regular season record, first playoff berth since 2021\n- Won Conference Championship 10-7 - very tight, defensive game\n\n**Key observations:**\n1.
