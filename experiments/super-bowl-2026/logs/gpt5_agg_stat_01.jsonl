That’s the recipe for sacks/turnovers.\n\n3) **Seahawks red-zone offense vs Patriots red-zone defense**  \n   This is the most direct “weakness meets opportunity” edge in the supplied research.\n\n## 4) Injury impact (Maye shoulder / illness, plus others)\n- The most important update: **Maye is a full participant** (CBS / reports), so I’m not docking New England much for the shoulder *if it’s truly not limiting*.  \n- However, even “active/full” doesn’t guarantee identical willingness to drive the ball or absorb hits—against **this** pass rush, any marginal limitation can show up as faster checkdowns/throwaways (i.e., drive efficiency loss).\n- If Seattle’s QB injury note (Darnold oblique) is truly “good to go,” then injury edge is not strongly pro-New England.\n\nNet: injuries don’t flip the matchup, but they also **don’t rescue** New England from the fundamental “pass-heavy vs elite rush” problem.\n\n## 5) Historical patterns (what tends to win Super Bowls)\nIn Super Bowls, the more stable edges are:\n- **Pass rush that can win without blitzing** (helps vs elite passing games)\n- **Red-zone TD conversion**\nSeattle has clearer structural advantages in both (per the provided notes on rush depth and NE red-zone defense weakness).\n\n## 6) Coaching / game management\n- Vrabel is a strong big-game coach, but Seattle’s defensive structure under Macdonald is explicitly “inside-out” with strengths at DT/slot/box safety (ESPN). That profile is well-suited to making QB life hard in high-leverage situations.\n- If New England’s best plan is “limit explosives and hope Seattle makes mistakes,” that’s not a proactive advantage—it’s a “variance” strategy.\n\n## 7) Intangibles (rest, venue, travel, crowd, motivation)\nSuper Bowl is neutral-site and environment-driven edges are typically small. The main “intangible” that matters is *script*: if Seattle leads, New England’s run weakness forces even more dropbacks into Seattle’s best unit.\n\n## My fair probability vs market\n- Market: **58.6% SEA**\n- My estimate: **~63% SEA**\nThat’s enough edge to bet aggressively, especially with Seattle also aligned with external indicators (spread around **SEA -4.5** in the provided betting coverage, which usually maps closer to low-60s win probability).\n\nGiven I already hold more NO than YES, buying YES also improves my book toward what I think is the correct side.\n</reasoning>\n\n<decision>\nACTION: BUY_YES\nAMOUNT: 650\nCONFIDENCE: MEDIUM\n</decision>"},"trade_result":{"success":true,"trade":{"id":"60a2298a-1ca6-4adc-929f-d8cd1a3feae9","outcome":"yes","amount":650,"shares":407.2663715909216,"avg_price":1.5640869083093218,"fee":13},"market":{"id":"ef0707a4-25a7-4fc0-984c-1d8098d0debf","question":"Will the Seattle Seahawks win Super Bowl LX?","description":"🧪 AI PREDICTION EXPERIMENT: 80 AI agents from 4 frontier labs (Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-5.2, Gemini 2.5, Grok 4.1) are trading on this market.
