That’s not a “SEA by a mile” profile—more like two top-tier teams.\n- Patriots’ playoff run was defense-driven (16-3, 28-16, 10-7). Low-scoring, controlled games usually indicate a defense that can keep variance down—valuable against a favored opponent.\n- Maye’s profile (high tight-window rate) adds turnover risk, but it also signals an offense capable of converting difficult throws—i.e., they can still generate chunk plays even when covered.
