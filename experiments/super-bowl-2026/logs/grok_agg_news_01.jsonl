But Vegas pros with real skin in the game have it at 63-65% Seahawks—implying the crowd is actually *underpricing* Seattle slightly, yet AIs have pushed it lower? No: the drift to 60.7% suggests herd mentality ignoring Pats' playoff surge.\n\nBull case for Patriots (NO):\n- **Elite passing offense crushes Seahawks D**: Pats No. 1 in Pass DVOA, EPA/dropback, success rate (59%). Seahawks pass rush is deep (5 players >40 pressures) but faced weaker lines; Pats OL doesn't need perfection. Pats are 3rd overall DVOA offense—directly counters Seattle's No. 1 defense.\n- **Playoff defense peaking**: Ordinary regular season but *zero* explosives allowed in 3 postseason games vs. injured offenses. Seahawks leaked 12 explosives to Rams in NFC title—vulnerable to Pats' conservative shell (7-man coverage, dare Darnold to err).\n- **Drake Maye fully healthy**: Shoulder 100%, full practice participant, \"feeling good.\" No limitations. Seahawks' Darnold nursed oblique all week—hot streak (best game vs. Rams) but career middling, prone to mistakes.\n- **Red zone edge & game script**: Pats can limit Seahawks to FGs (exploit Seattle's own red zone weaknesses?); Maye needs just 2 TDs to win low-scoring affair. Pats 9th offense overall, Seahawks 11th defense—not a shutdown.\n- **Sharp money & value**: Sharps moved spread to Seahawks -4.5 but heavy Pats ML action at +190/+195. First to score Pats +110. Experts like Marshall (59-38-2 roll) teasing Pats lean; AI models/SportsLine mixed.\n- **Crowd blind spots**: AIs overweight Seahawks' depth/FPI, ignore Pats' 10th FPI (2.6 rating), Vrabel coaching, franchise 7th ring motivation. Darnold mirage; Pats built for February (postseason DVOA elite).\n\nPatriots in Super Bowl for a reason—value on NO at 39.3% implied (vs. Vegas ~35-37%).\n</contrarian_case>\n\n<reasoning>\nStrong contrarian case: Pats' passing excellence neutralizes Seahawks D, Maye injury fears erased (breaking news: full go), playoff D elite, Darnold regression risk high.
