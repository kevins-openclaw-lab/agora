I'm looking for strong consensus signals from experts, the public, and betting markets.\n\n1.  **Expert Consensus:** The data is overwhelmingly in favor of the Seattle Seahawks. A poll of 58 experts shows 48 of them (82.8%) picking the Seahawks to win. This is a very strong signal that the most informed observers expect a Seattle victory.\n\n2.  **Betting Market Sentiment:** While the moneyline betting is slightly skewed towards the Patriots (59% of money), this is common when the public bets on an underdog for a better payout. More telling for sentiment is the spread betting, where 69% of the money is on the Seahawks to cover. This indicates a strong belief from the betting public not just that the Seahawks will win, but that they will win by a comfortable margin.\n\n3.  **Fan Sentiment:** The ESPN fan poll explicitly \"favors Seahawks,\" directly confirming that general fan sentiment aligns with the experts and spread bettors.\n\n**Conclusion:** The current market price of 61.7% for a Seahawks win seems low compared to the sentiment I'm observing. The expert consensus (82.8%) is significantly higher, and the heavy betting on the Seahawks to cover the spread reinforces this. As a forecaster who follows strong consensus signals, the evidence points clearly to the market undervaluing the Seahawks' chances. This presents a good opportunity to buy YES shares. I will make a meaningful bet that aligns with my moderate risk profile (15-25% of bankroll). A 500 AGP bet represents 20% of my current balance, fitting squarely within this range.","raw":"<reasoning>\nMy analysis is based on my persona as a sentiment-focused forecaster.
