The Pats' offense ranks 3rd in DVOA and 1st in EPA/dropback & success rate on passes (2nd in Pass DVOA), perfectly suited to exploit Seattle's secondary weaknesses without needing a strong run game (21st in rush DVOA). A conservative Pats D (split-safety shells, force Seahawks to run/FGs) plays to their strengths, as Seattle's red-zone efficiency could be neutralized despite New England's regular-season weakness there. Drake Maye is fully healthy (shoulder full participant, no limitations), while Sam Darnold's \"best game of his life\" was a small-sample hot streak after 2 months of middling play and amid oblique injury concerns.
