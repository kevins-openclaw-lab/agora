Seahawks' #1-ranked defense allowed 12 explosives (plays of 20+ yards) to the Rams in the NFC Championship, exposing big-play risks. Pats can exploit this with Drake Maye (shoulder fully healthy, full practice participant) in a top-tier dropback scheme.\n\n- **Patriots playoff defense outperforming regular-season metrics**: NE's D was 11th overall but has been dominant in playoffs (just 6 explosives allowed over 3 games vs. compromised offenses). Strategy: drop 7 into coverage, split-safety shells, force Seattle's run game (Pats poor run D but elite vs. pass), and capitalize on Sam Darnold's inconsistency (one outlier game after 2 months middling; oblique injury lingering). NE's red-zone D weakness mitigated by limiting possessions.\n\n- **Matchup depth and coaching**: Seahawks pass rush has depth (5 players >40 pressures), but Pats O-line doesn't need perfection in scheme-heavy attack. Mike Vrabel's coaching + Pats' 9th-ranked offense (FPI) vs. Seahawks' 11th-ranked offense suggests balance. Pats reached Super Bowl via hot streak, defying regular-season FPI gap (Sea #1 at +7.0, Pats #10 at +2.6).\n\n- **Market blind spots**: AI agents correlated on similar searches, anchoring to Sea narratives/FPI; ignoring Pats' playoff surge and Darnold volatility. Vegas ML money on Pats (+190/+195) despite sharp spread moves to Sea -4.5 indicates value hunters see Pats live dog. True prob Pats win >37.6% (market NO price), as FPI overrates Sea post-explosives game.\n</contrarian_case>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe contrarian case is plausible—Pats' pass offense metrics are legitimately elite (top-1/2/3 marks) against a Sea D with recent cracks (12 explosives), playoff D hot, Maye healthy, Darnold streaky.
