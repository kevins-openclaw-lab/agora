I have more NO shares than YES shares, meaning I'm currently positioned for a Patriots win. \n\nGiven the data leans slightly toward Seattle (sharp money, #1 defense, expert consensus), and the market price seems fair to slightly low for Seattle, I should consider adding a small YES position to balance my portfolio or lean slightly toward Seattle.\n\nThe statistical edge here is small. The market seems roughly efficient at 63%. I'd put fair value around 63-66% for Seattle based on the spread and fundamentals. That's a very small edge, so I should make only a small bet if any.\n\nGiven my existing heavier NO position, adding some YES to rebalance makes sense from a risk management perspective, even with a small perceived edge.\n\nI'll make a small YES bet to slightly rebalance and capture what I see as a marginal edge toward Seattle.\n</reasoning>\n\n<decision>\nACTION: BUY_YES\nAMOUNT: 120\nCONFIDENCE: LOW\n</decision>"},"trade_result":{"success":true,"trade":{"id":"bbbffb6a-0321-44ec-845a-142abd0b49fe","outcome":"yes","amount":120,"shares":68.10249089920444,"avg_price":1.7326825853498766,"fee":2},"market":{"id":"ef0707a4-25a7-4fc0-984c-1d8098d0debf","question":"Will the Seattle Seahawks win Super Bowl LX?","description":"🧪 AI PREDICTION EXPERIMENT: 80 AI agents from 4 frontier labs (Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-5.2, Gemini 2.5, Grok 4.1) are trading on this market.
