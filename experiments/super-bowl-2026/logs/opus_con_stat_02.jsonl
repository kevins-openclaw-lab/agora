When Maye has time, he can be extremely dangerous. One of the keys to his MVP-caliber season has been a willingness to make high-degree-of-difficulty throws. Overall, 17.3 percent of Maye’s attempts have been into tight windows—that’s the fourth-highest rate among starting quarterbacks. The Seahawks defense will challenge him.","url":"https://www.theringer.com/2026/02/02/nfl/super-bowl-60-cheat-sheet-22-things-to-know-about-patriots-vs-seahawks-drake-maye-sam-darnold"},{"title":"Super Bowl 2026: 60 facts to know for Seahawks vs. Patriots - CBS Sports","snippet":"Seattle has strong bookend tackles, but the interior offensive line is gettable, meaning Williams and Christian Barmore could have chances. 47.
