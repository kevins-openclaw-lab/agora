Seahawks def (#1 overall) allowed 12 explosives to Rams in NFC Champ—Pats have generated explosives efficiently all year and can exploit this in one-on-one matchups.\n\n- **Playoff-tested Pats defense**: Ordinary regular-season advanced metrics, but allowed just 6 explosives over 3 postseason games vs. compromised offenses. Strategy: conservative shells, force Sea to run (Pats 9th vs run), live with FGs from Darnold (oblique history). Pats red-zone def weakness mitigated if they prevent drives from reaching it.\n\n- **QB health edge**: Drake Maye full participant, shoulder \"all good,\" no limitations. Darnold nursed oblique into playoffs—susceptible to mistakes under pressure from Sea's deep pass rush (5 players >40 pressures).\n\n- **Market blind spots**: AI herd anchored on Sea FPI (#1 vs #10), ignoring Pats offensive efficiency and playoff D improvement. Vegas spread -4.5 (-230 ML ~70% Sea) but sharp money on Pats +190 ML shows pro respect. Information cascade overlooks Pats road to SB (underdogs thriving). Vrabel coaching + Pats OL doesn't need perfection vs. Sea rush depth.\n\n- **Key stats tilt**: Pats 9th offense/11th def vs. Sea 11th off/1st def—closer matchup than FPI suggests.
