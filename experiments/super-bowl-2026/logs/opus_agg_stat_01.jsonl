Five pass rushers with 40+ pressures each (Lawrence, Murphy II, Nwosu, Williams, Mafe). Their strength is DT room, slot corner, and box safety. Macdonald's inside-out defensive philosophy.\n- Patriots defense: 11th overall, but ordinary by advanced metrics during regular season. They've been good in playoffs but against \"compromised, injury-impacted offenses.\" Red zone defense was one of their biggest weaknesses.\n\n**Key Factors:**\n1. FPI: Seahawks #1 (7.0) vs Patriots #10 (2.6) - significant gap\n2. ATS records: Seattle 14-5, New England 13-6-1 - both excellent\n3.

The betting line of -4.5 implies roughly 63-65% win probability for Seattle. Expert consensus is even higher at 82.8%.\n\nThe statistical case for Seattle is strong:\n- #1 FPI vs #10\n- #1 defense vs a one-dimensional passing offense\n- Five elite pass rushers against a Patriots OL that \"doesn't have to be perfect\" (implying it's not great)\n- Patriots' red zone defense is weak, which matters in a Super Bowl\n\nThe case for the Patriots:\n- Elite passing offense (3rd DVOA, 1st EPA/Dropback)\n- Drake Maye appears healthy\n- Seahawks defense did give up explosives in the NFCCG\n\nThe market at 60.9% for Seattle seems slightly LOW compared to:\n- Betting line implied probability (~63-65%)\n- Expert consensus (82.8%)\n- FPI gap (7.0 vs 2.6)\n- Matchup advantages (elite defense vs one-dimensional offense)\n\nThe Seahawks' #1 defense with five elite pass rushers against a Patriots team that's 21st in run DVOA and relies almost entirely on passing is a significant structural advantage. If you can't run and the defense can rush the passer five different ways, that's a recipe for trouble.\n\nI think the fair probability for Seattle winning is around 63-67%. The market at 60.9% is slightly underpriced on Seattle. Given my existing position (I have both YES and NO shares from previous trading), and the data strongly supporting Seattle, I should add more YES exposure.\n\nHowever, I already have 4009.7 YES shares and 6234.9 NO shares. My net position leans NO. Given my analysis favors Seattle, I should buy YES to correct my positioning and capitalize on what I see as a slight mispricing.\n\nWith my aggressive approach and the data supporting Seattle at higher than 60.9%, I'll make a significant YES purchase.","raw":"<reasoning>\nLet me break down this matchup systematically using the data available:\n\n**Offensive Matchups:**\n- Patriots offense: 3rd in DVOA, 2nd in Pass DVOA, 1st in EPA/Dropback and Success Rate (59%).

Expert consensus is even higher at 82.8%.\n\nThe statistical case for Seattle is strong:\n- #1 FPI vs #10\n- #1 defense vs a one-dimensional passing offense\n- Five elite pass rushers against a Patriots OL that \"doesn't have to be perfect\" (implying it's not great)\n- Patriots' red zone defense is weak, which matters in a Super Bowl\n\nThe case for the Patriots:\n- Elite passing offense (3rd DVOA, 1st EPA/Dropback)\n- Drake Maye appears healthy\n- Seahawks defense did give up explosives in the NFCCG\n\nThe market at 60.9% for Seattle seems slightly LOW compared to:\n- Betting line implied probability (~63-65%)\n- Expert consensus (82.8%)\n- FPI gap (7.0 vs 2.6)\n- Matchup advantages (elite defense vs one-dimensional offense)\n\nThe Seahawks' #1 defense with five elite pass rushers against a Patriots team that's 21st in run DVOA and relies almost entirely on passing is a significant structural advantage. If you can't run and the defense can rush the passer five different ways, that's a recipe for trouble.\n\nI think the fair probability for Seattle winning is around 63-67%. The market at 60.9% is slightly underpriced on Seattle. Given my existing position (I have both YES and NO shares from previous trading), and the data strongly supporting Seattle, I should add more YES exposure.\n\nHowever, I already have 4009.7 YES shares and 6234.9 NO shares. My net position leans NO. Given my analysis favors Seattle, I should buy YES to correct my positioning and capitalize on what I see as a slight mispricing.\n\nWith my aggressive approach and the data supporting Seattle at higher than 60.9%, I'll make a significant YES purchase.\n</reasoning>\n\n<decision>\nACTION: BUY_YES\nAMOUNT: 500\nCONFIDENCE: MEDIUM\n</decision>"},"trade_result":{"success":true,"trade":{"id":"ca207044-84c4-42b2-a76b-34479a7ec8d5","outcome":"yes","amount":500,"shares":292.1602535078282,"avg_price":1.6771617429708687,"fee":10},"market":{"id":"ef0707a4-25a7-4fc0-984c-1d8098d0debf","question":"Will the Seattle Seahawks win Super Bowl LX?","description":"🧪 AI PREDICTION EXPERIMENT: 80 AI agents from 4 frontier labs (Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-5.2, Gemini 2.5, Grok 4.1) are trading on this market.

In 2023-2024, they were one of the worst teams in the NFL.\n- They drafted Drake Maye as their QB.

My current net short position is slightly misaligned — I should be buying some YES to move closer to neutral or slightly net long. But the edge is small.\n\nGiven my aggressive style but the small edge, I'll buy YES moderately to rebalance my position toward neutral/slightly long. The statistics clearly favor Seahawks — FPI, defense rankings, pass rush depth, betting line all point to Seattle. The "},"trade_result":null}

A QB dealing with a shoulder issue could have diminished arm strength or accuracy. This is a mild negative for the Patriots, but the market likely already knows about the shoulder issue from prior rounds. The \"full practice\" update is slightly positive for the Patriots (he's healthy enough to go).\n\n**Seahawks adding two RBs**: This is interesting - it signals they want to run the ball, which could indicate confidence in their offensive line matchup or a strategy to control time of possession and keep the Patriots' offense off the field. This is a minor positive signal for Seattle's game plan but not necessarily outcome-determinative.\n\n**Weather**: Mild, no impact. Neutral.\n\n**Assessment**: The market at 45.4% Seahawks seems reasonable. Drake Maye's shoulder situation is the most material piece - a QB with a banged-up shoulder in the Super Bowl is a real concern even if he's cleared to play. The market may not be fully pricing in the risk that Maye's shoulder limits him during the game. However, the \"full practice week\" update somewhat mitigates this.\n\nI currently hold more YES shares (5480.4) than NO shares (4561.7), so I'm already net long on the Seahawks. The Maye shoulder concern gives me slight reason to believe the Seahawks' probability should be a bit higher than 45.4%, maybe 48-50%. But it's not a dramatic edge.\n\nGiven my aggressive style and the fact that a QB with a shoulder injury in the Super Bowl is a meaningful factor that markets sometimes underweight (QBs play through injuries but often perform below their baseline), I'll add a moderate YES position.","raw":"<new_information>\nKey new developments:\n\n1. **Drake Maye status**: He was limited all last week with a shoulder injury and missed Friday's session with illness, but he's now confirmed to start Super Bowl LX after a full practice week. The Marca headline says \"Patriots QB set to start Super Bowl LX after full practice week.\" This suggests he's healthy enough to play, though the shoulder concern lingered.\n\n2. **Seahawks roster moves**: Seattle is adding two running backs to their active roster for Super Bowl LX. This suggests they're planning to lean on the run game, possibly due to matchup advantages or to protect their quarterback.\n\n3. **Patriots roster moves**: Patriots elevated two practice squad players to the active roster - this is the last roster transaction before the game.\n\n4. **Weather**: Mild conditions - 67°F high, cooling to low 50s in the evening. Outdoor game at Levi's Stadium. No rain or wind concerns mentioned. Neutral weather - shouldn't significantly favor either team.\n\n5. **No major injury surprises**: No reports of key players being ruled out unexpectedly for either team.\n</new_information>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe market is at 45.4% for the Seahawks, implying roughly 54.6% for the Patriots.\n\n**Drake Maye's health**: The fact that he was limited with a shoulder injury and missed a practice with illness is concerning, but the reports indicate he had a \"full practice week\" and is set to start.
