When Maye has time, he can be extremely dangerous. One of the keys to his MVP-caliber season has been a willingness to make high-degree-of-difficulty throws. Overall, 17.3 percent of Maye’s attempts have been into tight windows—that’s the fourth-highest rate among starting quarterbacks. The Seahawks defense will challenge him.","url":"https://www.theringer.com/2026/02/02/nfl/super-bowl-60-cheat-sheet-22-things-to-know-about-patriots-vs-seahawks-drake-maye-sam-darnold"},{"title":"Super Bowl 2026: 60 facts to know for Seahawks vs. Patriots - CBS Sports","snippet":"Seattle has strong bookend tackles, but the interior offensive line is gettable, meaning Williams and Christian Barmore could have chances. 47.

The Patriots' playoff path shows a DOMINANT defense - allowing only 3, 16, and 7 points. That 10-7 AFC Championship win over Denver screams elite defense.\n2. The Patriots' offense has been explosive but their playoff scoring has been modest (16, 28, 10) - suggesting they win with defense first.\n3. Seattle's explosive-play differential is the best in the league - they create big plays and prevent them.\n4. The market has Seahawks at 59.1%, which feels about right for a home-field type advantage or being the slightly better team.\n\n**Statistical lean:** This looks like a very competitive matchup. The Patriots' defense has been absolutely suffocating in the playoffs. Their offense has Maye who can make special throws. Seattle has the better explosive-play differential overall.\n\nThe market at 59.1% for Seattle seems reasonable but possibly slightly high. The Patriots' defensive playoff performance (8.7 points allowed per game) is elite. Their path through the playoffs beating quality opponents (Chargers, Texans, Broncos) shows they're battle-tested.\n\nHowever, Seattle's league-best explosive-play differential and strong overall stats suggest they're the better team statistically. The 59.1% price seems roughly fair, maybe even slightly low for Seattle given their statistical dominance in key categories.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Super Bowls are close games. The Patriots' defensive dominance in the playoffs is a huge factor. They held three playoff opponents to an average of ~8.7 points. That's historically elite. Seattle's interior OL vulnerability against Williams and Barmore could be exploited.\n\nI think the market at 59.1% for Seattle is slightly too high. The Patriots' elite playoff defense and Maye's big-play ability make this closer to 50-50 or maybe 52-48 Seattle.
