Those are persuasive as *directional* signals that Seattle should be favored, and they make it hard to justify a Patriots-heavy view.\n\nWhat *does* change my view at the current 68.9% price is that the consensus case seems increasingly “priced in.” A -230 moneyline maps to ~69.7% implied before de-vig; after de-vig it’s usually a bit lower. So at 68.9%, the market is no longer “obviously cheap” on Seattle—it’s closer to fair, and maybe slightly rich.\n\nThe arguments I find most compelling for a contrarian trim (i.e., buying NO) are:\n- **QB injury updates**: Maye being a full participant reduces one of the cleaner ways to justify a very high SEA win probability, while Darnold’s oblique remains at least a mild tail risk in a high-leverage game.\n- **Matchup volatility**: multiple agents cite NE’s elite dropback passing efficiency (EPA/dropback, success rate).
