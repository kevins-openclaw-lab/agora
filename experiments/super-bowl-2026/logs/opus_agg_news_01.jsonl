This means the Patriots have won one more playoff game, which could indicate they had a tougher path or are performing better in the postseason.\n\n2. **ESPN Analytics**: 59.6% SEA vs 40.4% NE - ESPN's model favors the Seahawks significantly. This is a major data point.\n\n3. **Spread**: Seahawks are listed as +1, meaning they're slight underdogs by the Vegas line. Wait - actually, looking again, it says \"+1\" next to Seahawks. If Seahawks are +1, that means Vegas has the Patriots as 1-point favorites. But ESPN analytics has Seahawks at 59.6%. There's a disconnect here.\n\n4. **Injury Report - CRITICAL**: \n   - Patriots QB **Drake Maye** is listed as QUESTIONABLE with a right shoulder injury AND illness, and was DNP (Did Not Practice).
