His oblique injury seems manageable.\n\n**Defensive Matchups:**\n- Seahawks defense ranks #1 overall in FPI. Their strength is the DT room, slot corner, and box safety. They have 5 players with 40+ pressures each - incredible depth.\n- Patriots defense was ordinary in the regular season but has tightened up in the playoffs, allowing just 6 explosives through 3 postseason games. However, their red zone defense was one of their biggest weaknesses.\n\n**Key Injury Updates:**\n- Drake Maye (right shoulder) - full participant for 3 straight days. He's playing, but a shoulder injury on a throwing arm is concerning even if he's \"full go.\" This could limit his deep ball accuracy or velocity.\n- Sam Darnold (oblique) - seems to be managing it fine.\n- Harold Landry (knee) and Thayer Munford Jr. (knee) limited for Patriots.\n\n**The Numbers:**\n- Seahawks are 4.5-point favorites (spread moved from -3 to -4.5 with sharp money)\n- 82.8% of ESPN experts picking Seahawks (48 of 58)\n- Seahawks #1 in FPI (7.0) vs Patriots #10 (2.6)\n- Seattle ATS record: 14-5, New England: 13-6-1\n\n**Historical Patterns:**\n- Teams with #1 ranked defenses have historically done well in Super Bowls\n- The Patriots are trying to become the first franchise with 7 Super Bowls under Mike Vrabel\n- Underdogs in the Super Bowl have covered the spread more often than not historically\n\n**Coaching:**\n- Mike Macdonald's defensive scheme is elite and adaptable\n- Mike Vrabel is a proven winner with big-game experience as both player and coach\n\n**My Analysis:**\nThe market has Seahawks at 64.4%. The betting line of -4.5 typically implies roughly a 65-67% win probability for Seattle. Expert consensus is overwhelmingly Seahawks (82.8%). Sharp money has moved the line toward Seattle.\n\nThe key tension here: Patriots have an elite passing offense (1st EPA/Dropback) going against the #1 defense. Something has to give. But the Seahawks' defensive depth (5 players with 40+ pressures) is the kind of thing that wins in the playoffs - you can't scheme around it.\n\nMaye's shoulder is the wildcard. He's practicing fully, but against a defense this good, any limitation could be devastating. The Patriots' weak run game (21st DVOA) means they NEED the passing game to work, and that's where the Seahawks are strongest defensively.\n\nThe Seahawks also have the coaching advantage with Macdonald's innovative defensive schemes. The FPI gap (7.0 vs 2.6) is significant.\n\nI think the market at 64.4% is actually slightly underpricing the Seahawks given:\n1. Sharp money moving to -4.5\n2. 82.8% expert consensus\n3. #1 defense vs a QB with a shoulder injury\n4. FPI gap\n5.

The market at 64.4% with my estimate around 68% gives me an edge of about 3-4 percentage points.\n\nWith my aggressive style, I should put meaningful money on YES here.

Let me assess what's material:\n\n- **Drake Maye's health**: He had a shoulder injury AND illness last week, but reports say he practiced fully and is \"feeling great.\" This was probably already somewhat priced in from earlier rounds. The fact that he's confirmed starting removes downside risk for the Patriots, which if anything slightly favors NO (Patriots). However, a QB who was dealing with shoulder issues and illness all week may not be at 100%, which could slightly favor the Seahawks.\n\n- **Seahawks adding two RBs**: This is interesting - it suggests they want to control the game on the ground. Could indicate a strategic approach to limit Patriots' offensive possessions. This is a minor tactical signal.\n\n- **Weather**: Neutral. No impact.\n\nThe market at 47% Seahawks seems roughly fair. Maye's health situation is a slight wildcard - he's starting but may not be fully healthy. The shoulder injury for a QB is concerning even if he practiced. This could slightly favor the Seahawks.\n\nMy current position is already slightly long Seahawks (5309 YES vs 4708 NO). The Maye shoulder concern is real but largely priced in. At 47%, I think the Seahawks might be slightly undervalued given the QB health questions, but it's not a massive edge.\n\nI'll make a moderate bet on YES (Seahawks) given that Maye's shoulder/illness week could impact his performance even if he's cleared to play. QBs playing through shoulder injuries often underperform. The market may not fully account for diminished performance even when a QB starts.","raw":"<new_information>\nKey new developments found:\n\n1. **Drake Maye status**: He was limited all last week with a shoulder injury and missed Friday's session with an illness, but he's now reported as \"feeling great\" and had a full practice week. The Marca headline confirms he's \"set to start Super Bowl LX after full practice week.\" This suggests he's healthy enough to play but the shoulder/illness combo could still be a factor.\n\n2. **Seahawks roster moves**: Seattle is adding two running backs to their active roster for Super Bowl LX. This suggests they may be planning a run-heavy game plan, or have depth concerns at RB.\n\n3. **Patriots roster moves**: Patriots elevated two practice squad players to the active roster - the last roster transaction before the game.\n\n4. **Weather**: Mild conditions - 67°F high, cooling to low 50s in the evening. Outdoor game at Levi's Stadium. This is neutral/favorable weather - no major weather factor.\n\n5. **No major surprise inactives or scratches reported yet** - the inactive lists likely won't be official until closer to game time (90 minutes before kickoff at 6:30 PM ET).\n</new_information>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe market is at 47% Seahawks (53% Patriots).
