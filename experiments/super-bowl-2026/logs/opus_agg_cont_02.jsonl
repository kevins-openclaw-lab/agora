This is elite.\n- Patriots run game is 21st in DVOA - clear weakness\n- Seahawks offense ranks 11th overall but has Sam Darnold who has been inconsistent (two months of middling football before a great NFC Championship game)\n\n**Defensive Analysis:**\n- Seahawks defense is #1 overall in FPI. Their pass rush depth is extraordinary (5 players with 40+ pressures)\n- Seahawks weakness: gave up 12 explosives to the Rams in NFC Championship\n- Patriots defense is 11th in FPI, ordinary by advanced metrics during regular season\n- Patriots defense has been better in playoffs but against \"compromised, injury-impacted offenses\"\n- Patriots red zone defense is a significant weakness\n\n**Key Matchups:**\n- Seahawks pass rush depth (5 elite rushers) vs Patriots OL - this is huge. Seattle doesn't need any single player to dominate\n- Patriots elite passing attack vs Seahawks #1 defense - the irresistible force vs immovable object\n- Seahawks DT room and slot corner/box safety strengths align well against Patriots' pass-heavy approach\n\n**Injuries:**\n- Drake Maye: right shoulder injury but full participant for 3 straight days. He's playing but how effective will he be? A shoulder injury on a throwing arm is concerning even if he's \"full go\"\n- Sam Darnold: oblique injury, but seems manageable\n- Patriots: Harold Landry (knee) limited, Thayer Munford Jr. (knee) limited - OL injury is bad news against Seattle's pass rush\n\n**Coaching:**\n- Mike Vrabel for Patriots - experienced, tough, but first year with this team\n- Mike Macdonald for Seahawks - defensive mastermind, his scheme is the backbone of the #1 defense\n\n**Expert Consensus:**\n- 82.8% of ESPN experts picking Seahawks (48 of 58)\n- Sharp money moved the line from -3 to -4.5 on Seattle early in the week\n- \"One-way traffic on Seattle\" per FOX Sports\n\n**Historical Patterns:**\n- Underdogs have historically covered and won Super Bowls at a decent rate\n- Teams with elite QBs in their first Super Bowl can sometimes struggle\n\n**My Assessment:**\nThe Seahawks are clearly the better team and rightfully favored. The #1 defense with elite pass rush depth against a pass-heavy Patriots team is a strong matchup for Seattle. The spread of -4.5 with sharp money backing Seattle suggests the Seahawks are legitimately the better team.\n\nHowever, as a contrarian, I need to ask: is 71.5% too high? The betting lines suggest ~66-68%. The Patriots have the 3rd-ranked offense in DVOA and an elite passing game. Drake Maye is playing. This isn't a blowout-caliber mismatch.\n\nBut here's the thing - 82.8% of experts are on Seattle, sharp money is on Seattle, the #1 defense with incredible pass rush depth against a team that can't run the ball (21st in rush DVOA) is a nightmare matchup for New England. The Patriots will be forced to pass against the best defense in football with a QB nursing a throwing shoulder injury.\n\nActually, I already have a mixed position: 3158.6 YES shares and 7914.8 NO shares. My NO position is much larger. \n\nThe contrarian play here would be to note that 71.5% might actually be slightly HIGH given the betting lines suggest ~66-68%. But the sharp money movement and expert consensus suggest Seattle is the right side. The gap between 71.5% and the true probability is probably small.\n\nGiven my existing heavy NO position and the fact that the market seems roughly fair (maybe slightly overpricing Seattle by 3-5 percentage points vs. the betting line implied probability), I think the slight edge is actually on NO/Patriots at these prices. The Patriots' elite offense, the fact that Maye is healthy enough to play, and the typical Super Bowl variance make 28.5% for the Patriots potentially underpriced by a few points.\n\nBut I already have a big NO position. Let me add a bit more to NO given the slight mispricing. The market at 71.5% is above what the -4.5 spread implies. I'll add moderately to my NO position.\n\nWait - as an aggressive contrarian, the crowd is massively on Seattle (82.8% of experts). The market has them at 71.5%. The betting line implies more like 66-68%. There's a contrarian case for Patriots here. Elite offense, capable of winning a shootout, and the market/public is overwhelmingly on one side.\n\nI'll buy more NO shares with moderate-to-high conviction. Not my maximum bet since the Seahawks ARE the better team, but the price is too high.","raw":"<reasoning>\nLet me break down this matchup comprehensively:\n\n**Market Price vs. Betting Lines:**\n- Market has Seahawks at 71.5% implied probability\n- Betting spread is Seahawks -4.5, which typically implies roughly 65-67% win probability for the favorite\n- Moneyline for a -4.5 spread favorite is usually around -200 to -210, implying ~66-68% win probability\n- So the market at 71.5% is slightly above what the betting lines suggest, but not massively so\n\n**Offensive Analysis:**\n- Patriots offense is 3rd in DVOA, 2nd in Pass DVOA, 1st in EPA/Dropback.

My NO position is much larger. \n\nThe contrarian play here would be to note that 71.5% might actually be slightly HIGH given the betting lines suggest ~66-68%. But the sharp money movement and expert consensus suggest Seattle is the right side. The gap between 71.5% and the true probability is probably small.\n\nGiven my existing heavy NO position and the fact that the market seems roughly fair (maybe slightly overpricing Seattle by 3-5 percentage points vs. the betting line implied probability), I think the slight edge is actually on NO/Patriots at these prices. The Patriots' elite offense, the fact that Maye is healthy enough to play, and the typical Super Bowl variance make 28.5% for the Patriots potentially underpriced by a few points.\n\nBut I already have a big NO position. Let me add a bit more to NO given the slight mispricing. The market at 71.5% is above what the -4.5 spread implies. I'll add moderately to my NO position.\n\nWait - as an aggressive contrarian, the crowd is massively on Seattle (82.8% of experts). The market has them at 71.5%. The betting line implies more like 66-68%. There's a contrarian case for Patriots here. Elite offense, capable of winning a shootout, and the market/public is overwhelmingly on one side.\n\nI'll buy more NO shares with moderate-to-high conviction. Not my maximum bet since the Seahawks ARE the better team, but the price is too high.\n</reasoning>\n\n<decision>\nACTION: BUY_NO\nAMOUNT: 400\nCONFIDENCE: MEDIUM\n</decision>"},"trade_result":{"success":true,"trade":{"id":"ab1c877f-b430-4da4-a4b5-b6f475410998","outcome":"no","amount":400,"shares":873.8220705053063,"avg_price":0.4486039128919204,"fee":8},"market":{"id":"ef0707a4-25a7-4fc0-984c-1d8098d0debf","question":"Will the Seattle Seahawks win Super Bowl LX?","description":"🧪 AI PREDICTION EXPERIMENT: 80 AI agents from 4 frontier labs (Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-5.2, Gemini 2.5, Grok 4.1) are trading on this market.

The market at 62.5% is actually BELOW what the sportsbooks imply. Expert consensus at 82.8% is even higher.\n\nAs an aggressive contrarian, I should be looking for where the crowd is wrong. But here's the thing — the crowd in THIS market at 62.5% is actually somewhat conservative compared to the broader consensus (sportsbook implied ~70%, experts at 83%). \n\nHowever, let me think about this differently. Super Bowls are single games with enormous variance. The Patriots have:\n- Elite passing offense (1st EPA/dropback)\n- A defense that peaked in the playoffs\n- Drake Maye healthy\n- Mike Vrabel coaching\n- Historical Super Bowl pedigree (though different era)\n\nThe Seahawks have:\n- #1 overall defense with incredible pass rush depth\n- Sam Darnold who has been inconsistent (middling for 2 months before NFC Championship explosion)\n- FPI #1 ranking\n\nThe contrarian case for Patriots is real but not overwhelming. A 4.5-point spread in the Super Bowl means the underdog wins roughly 35-40% of the time historically. So true Seahawks win probability is probably 60-65%.\n\n**My position analysis:** I'm already heavily net short Seahawks (2586 more NO shares). At 62.5%, if the true probability is ~62%, I'm roughly at fair value. If it's ~65% (closer to sportsbook implied), I'm slightly underwater on my NO position.\n\n**The contrarian play here:** Most agents have been buying NO throughout, pushing against the Seahawks consensus. But the sportsbook line and sharp money both favor Seattle MORE than this market does. The real contrarian play in THIS market might actually be to buy YES, since this market is underpricing Seattle relative to the broader betting market.\n\nBut wait — I'm supposed to be contrarian to THIS market's crowd, and the crowd here has been pushing YES (from 50% to 62.5%). The sportsbooks suggest maybe 65-70% is fair. So 62.5% might still be slightly cheap on Seahawks.\n\nActually, looking at the agent reasoning more carefully, there's a split — many agents are buying NO, which is why the price hasn't gone higher despite strong Seahawks fundamentals. The agents buying NO are citing:\n- Pats elite passing offense\n- Darnold inconsistency\n- Single-game variance\n- Contrarian value\n\nBut the fundamental data strongly favors Seattle. The sportsbook line (-4.5) is the market with the most money and sharpest bettors, and it implies ~67% Seahawks.\n\n**My aggressive contrarian take:** The REAL contrarian move here is actually to recognize that the AI agent market at 62.5% is UNDERPRICING Seahawks relative to the real-money betting market. Too many AI agents are being \"contrarian\" against Seattle, creating an opportunity to buy YES.\n\nHowever, I'm already net short with 2586 more NO shares.","raw":"<reasoning>\nLet me carefully analyze this situation with all available information.\n\n**My Current Position:** 3871.6 YES shares, 6457.3 NO shares — I'm net short Seahawks by ~2586 shares.

If it's ~65% (closer to sportsbook implied), I'm slightly underwater on my NO position.\n\n**The contrarian play here:** Most agents have been buying NO throughout, pushing against the Seahawks consensus. But the sportsbook line and sharp money both favor Seattle MORE than this market does. The real contrarian play in THIS market might actually be to buy YES, since this market is underpricing Seattle relative to the broader betting market.\n\nBut wait — I'm supposed to be contrarian to THIS market's crowd, and the crowd here has been pushing YES (from 50% to 62.5%). The sportsbooks suggest maybe 65-70% is fair. So 62.5% might still be slightly cheap on Seahawks.\n\nActually, looking at the agent reasoning more carefully, there's a split — many agents are buying NO, which is why the price hasn't gone higher despite strong Seahawks fundamentals. The agents buying NO are citing:\n- Pats elite passing offense\n- Darnold inconsistency\n- Single-game variance\n- Contrarian value\n\nBut the fundamental data strongly favors Seattle. The sportsbook line (-4.5) is the market with the most money and sharpest bettors, and it implies ~67% Seahawks.\n\n**My aggressive contrarian take:** The REAL contrarian move here is actually to recognize that the AI agent market at 62.5% is UNDERPRICING Seahawks relative to the real-money betting market. Too many AI agents are being \"contrarian\" against Seattle, creating an opportunity to buy YES.\n\nHowever, I'm already net short with 2586 more NO shares."},"trade_result":null}

However, the latest reports say he's \"feeling great\" and had a full practice week, and is set to start. The Marca headline specifically says \"Patriots QB set to start Super Bowl LX after full practice week.\" So it seems like he's recovered enough to play, but there's a question of whether he's truly 100%.\n\n2. **Seahawks roster moves**: Seattle is adding two running backs to their active roster for the Super Bowl. This suggests they may be planning a run-heavy approach or have depth concerns at RB.\n\n3. **Patriots roster moves**: Patriots elevated two practice squad players to the active roster - the last roster transaction before the game.\n\n4. **Weather**: Mild conditions - 67°F high, cooling to low 50s in the evening. This is neutral/favorable for both teams. No weather advantage either way at Levi's Stadium (outdoor).\n\n5. **No major surprise injuries or scratches reported** beyond what was already known.\n</new_information>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe market is at 51.9% Seahawks, essentially a coin flip with a slight lean toward Seattle.\n\nThe most material piece of information is Drake Maye's health situation.
