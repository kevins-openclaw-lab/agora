Sam Darnold had an oblique injury but appears healthy. Darnold has been inconsistent - \"two months of middling football\" before a great NFC Championship game.\n\n**Defensive Analysis:**\n- Seahawks: #1 ranked defense by FPI. Strength is DT room, slot corner, and box safety. Five players with 40+ pressures each - elite pass rush depth. This is a dominant unit.\n- Patriots: 11th ranked defense by FPI. Ordinary by advanced metrics during regular season. Red zone defense was one of their biggest weaknesses. However, they've allowed only 6 explosives through 3 playoff games (though against compromised offenses).\n\n**Key Matchups:**\n- Patriots elite passing attack vs. Seahawks #1 defense - this is THE matchup. Seahawks gave up 12 explosives to the Rams in the NFCG, showing they can be challenged.\n- Seahawks pass rush depth (5 players with 40+ pressures) vs. Patriots OL - Patriots don't need to be perfect but face serious pressure.\n\n**Spread & Market:**\n- Seahawks are -4.5 point favorites, with sharps moving the line from -3 to -4.5.\n- 82.8% of ESPN experts picked Seahawks (48 of 58).\n- ATS records: Seattle 14-5, New England 13-6-1 - both excellent.\n- Market price: 67.5% Seahawks.\n\n**Statistical Assessment:**\nA 4.5-point spread typically corresponds to roughly 62-65% implied win probability for the favorite. The market at 67.5% is slightly above what the spread implies. Expert consensus at 82.8% is much higher than the market.\n\nThe Seahawks have clear advantages:\n1. #1 overall defense vs. a Patriots offense that, while elite in passing, is one-dimensional (weak run game)\n2. Superior FPI rating (7.0 vs 2.6)\n3. Pass rush depth to pressure Maye\n4. Home-field type advantage (game in New Orleans, but Seahawks are the clear favorites)\n\nPatriots' path to victory:\n1. Elite passing game could exploit Seahawks if they get time\n2. Seahawks gave up explosives to the Rams\n3. Patriots red zone defense weakness could be offset if they can limit Seahawks to FGs\n4. Maye appears healthy enough to play\n\n**My Assessment:**\nThe spread at -4.5 implies roughly 63-65% Seahawks win probability. The market at 67.5% is slightly rich but not dramatically so. The Seahawks' defensive dominance (#1 FPI) against a pass-heavy, run-weak Patriots offense is a significant edge. However, the Patriots' elite passing efficiency (1st EPA/Dropback) means they can compete.\n\nI'd put the true probability at around 63-66% Seahawks. The market at 67.5% is at the upper end of my range or slightly above it. There might be a tiny edge on NO but it's not large.\n\n**Current Position:**\nI have 3469.6 YES shares and 7205.5 NO shares. I'm already somewhat hedged with more NO shares. Given my assessment that 67.5% might be 1-3% too high for the Seahawks, a small additional NO bet could be warranted, but the edge is slim.\n\nGiven my conservative approach and the small perceived edge, I'll make a small NO bet to capitalize on what I see as slight market overpricing of the Seahawks.","raw":"<reasoning>\nLet me break down this matchup systematically using the data available.\n\n**Offensive Analysis:**\n- Patriots: 3rd in DVOA, 2nd in Pass DVOA, 1st in EPA/Dropback and Success Rate (59%).

The market at 67.5% is slightly above what the spread implies. Expert consensus at 82.8% is much higher than the market.\n\nThe Seahawks have clear advantages:\n1. #1 overall defense vs. a Patriots offense that, while elite in passing, is one-dimensional (weak run game)\n2. Superior FPI rating (7.0 vs 2.6)\n3. Pass rush depth to pressure Maye\n4. Home-field type advantage (game in New Orleans, but Seahawks are the clear favorites)\n\nPatriots' path to victory:\n1. Elite passing game could exploit Seahawks if they get time\n2. Seahawks gave up explosives to the Rams\n3. Patriots red zone defense weakness could be offset if they can limit Seahawks to FGs\n4. Maye appears healthy enough to play\n\n**My Assessment:**\nThe spread at -4.5 implies roughly 63-65% Seahawks win probability. The market at 67.5% is slightly rich but not dramatically so. The Seahawks' defensive dominance (#1 FPI) against a pass-heavy, run-weak Patriots offense is a significant edge. However, the Patriots' elite passing efficiency (1st EPA/Dropback) means they can compete.\n\nI'd put the true probability at around 63-66% Seahawks. The market at 67.5% is at the upper end of my range or slightly above it. There might be a tiny edge on NO but it's not large.\n\n**Current Position:**\nI have 3469.6 YES shares and 7205.5 NO shares. I'm already somewhat hedged with more NO shares. Given my assessment that 67.5% might be 1-3% too high for the Seahawks, a small additional NO bet could be warranted, but the edge is slim.\n\nGiven my conservative approach and the small perceived edge, I'll make a small NO bet to capitalize on what I see as slight market overpricing of the Seahawks.\n</reasoning>\n\n<decision>\nACTION: BUY_NO\nAMOUNT: 75\nCONFIDENCE: LOW\n</decision>"},"trade_result":{"success":true,"trade":{"id":"618cca8c-5509-4f30-89f1-daae20b7d504","outcome":"no","amount":75,"shares":150.47117924539452,"avg_price":0.49178852967795106,"fee":1},"market":{"id":"ef0707a4-25a7-4fc0-984c-1d8098d0debf","question":"Will the Seattle Seahawks win Super Bowl LX?","description":"🧪 AI PREDICTION EXPERIMENT: 80 AI agents from 4 frontier labs (Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-5.2, Gemini 2.5, Grok 4.1) are trading on this market.

Given my conservative approach, I might add a small NO position since 62.7% seems slightly high for a Super Bowl matchup, but I should be cautious since I lack current information.\n\nI'll make a small bet on NO, as Super Bowl pricing typically doesn't warrant 62.7% for one side without a clear dominant team, and I trust the historical base rate of Super Bowls being close games.\n</reasoning>\n\n<decision>\nACTION: BUY_NO\nAMOUNT: 100\nCONFIDENCE: LOW\n</decision>"},"trade_result":{"success":true,"trade":{"id":"a74d5aa5-d362-48b5-b241-ce6ca1b8dce5","outcome":"no","amount":100,"shares":160.7793467906149,"avg_price":0.6095310247007454,"fee":2},"market":{"id":"ef0707a4-25a7-4fc0-984c-1d8098d0debf","question":"Will the Seattle Seahawks win Super Bowl LX?","description":"🧪 AI PREDICTION EXPERIMENT: 80 AI agents from 4 frontier labs (Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-5.2, Gemini 2.5, Grok 4.1) are trading on this market.

This is actually slightly positive for the Patriots - he's cleared to play and apparently healthy enough.\n\n2. **Seahawks roster moves**: Seattle is adding two running backs to their active roster for Super Bowl LX. This suggests they may be planning a run-heavy approach or need depth due to RB health concerns. Without knowing which RBs or why, this is minor.\n\n3. **Patriots roster moves**: Patriots elevated two practice squad players to the active roster - the last roster transaction before the game.\n\n4. **Weather**: Mild conditions - high of 67°F, cooling to low 50s in the evening. Outdoors at Levi's Stadium. This is favorable, neutral weather that shouldn't significantly advantage either team.\n\n5. **No major injury surprises**: No reports of key players being ruled out unexpectedly for either team.\n</new_information>\n\n<reasoning>\nAssessing materiality of new information:\n\n- Drake Maye's health trajectory is actually slightly better than it might have been feared - he had a shoulder injury and illness but practiced fully. This was likely already priced in given the market has had days to absorb this. If anything, confirmation he's fully healthy is marginally positive for Patriots (negative for Seahawks win probability).\n\n- The Seahawks adding two RBs could signal either strategic choice (run-heavy game plan) or necessity (injury concerns at RB). Without more detail, this is ambiguous but slightly concerning - teams don't usually make roster moves like this unless they need to.\n\n- Weather is neutral - no wind, rain, or extreme conditions that would favor one team's style over another.\n\n- No major surprises in either direction.\n\nThe market is at 41.3% for Seahawks. My current position is net long Seahawks (5961.3 YES vs 4193.7 NO). The news is marginally favorable to the Patriots (Maye healthy, no major Patriot concerns), which would suggest the Seahawks probability might tick down slightly. However, none of this is dramatically new or market-moving.\n\nGiven my conservative approach and that nothing here is truly material enough to move the needle significantly, the best action is to HOLD. The information is largely confirmatory of what was already known, and the market price seems reasonable given the available data.\n</reasoning>\n\n<decision>\nACTION: HOLD\nAMOUNT: 0\nCONFIDENCE: MEDIUM\nNEWS_IMPACT: MINOR\n</decision>","newsImpact":"MINOR"},"trade_result":null}
