The New England Patriots' starting quarterback, Drake Maye, is listed as DNP (Did Not Practice) due to a right shoulder injury AND an illness. This is happening just days before the Super Bowl.\n\nA starting quarterback not practicing this late in the week is a catastrophic development. Even if he plays, a shoulder injury will impact his throwing, and the illness will sap his strength and focus. The quarterback is the single most important position in football, and the Patriots' QB1 is severely compromised.\n\nWhile the market has already priced the Seahawks as heavy favorites at 68.6%, I believe it is *underreacting* to the severity of this news. A compromised or backup quarterback drastically reduces a team's chances of winning the Super Bowl. ESPN's analytics put the Seahawks at 59.6%, but that model may not have fully weighted a DNP status this close to gametime. The Seahawks having a long injury list is a concern, but the specificity and importance of the Patriots' QB injury outweighs it.\n\nThis is the exact type of high-impact, late-breaking information I look for. The price is high, but the probability of a Seahawks win against a team with a non-practicing QB is even higher. I'm making a big, aggressive move on this news.","raw":"<reasoning>\nMy entire strategy is built on reacting decisively to breaking news, and the injury report contains a bombshell.
