New England's playoff defense has been lights-out, allowing just 6 explosives over three games against compromised offenses—far better than regular-season metrics suggest—and can play conservative split-safety shells to force mistakes from a middling Sam Darnold (oblique injury nagging, one hot game vs. Rams not sustainable). Drake Maye is fully cleared (shoulder \"all good,\" full practice participant), neutralizing the key injury narrative. Pats red zone offense can capitalize on Seattle's potential FG-only outputs, while their OL holds up against Seattle's pass-rush depth (doesn't need to be perfect). Vegas ML +190 implies ~37% Pats win probability (matching market NO), but sharp money on Pats ML and stagnant line movement suggest value if crowd ignores Pats' 9th-ranked offense vs. 11th-ranked Seahawks D.
