Drake Maye is a full participant at practice - his shoulder seems fine enough to play.\n\n2. **Defensive matchup - Seahawks #1 defense vs Patriots #3 offense**: This is the classic unstoppable force vs immovable object.

The Seahawks gave up 12 explosives to the Rams in the NFCC - they're not invincible.\n\n3. **Patriots defense concerns**: Their defense was \"ordinary during the regular season by advanced metrics\" and their red zone defense was one of their biggest weaknesses.

Since 2000, underdogs have won roughly 40% of Super Bowls. A 29.6% implied probability for the Patriots seems too low given historical base rates for Super Bowl underdogs, especially those getting less than a touchdown.\n\n7. **Sharp money**: The line moved FROM -3 TO -4.5, suggesting sharp money is on Seattle. But even at -4.5, the implied win probability (~63%) is well below the market's 70.4%.\n\n8. **Sam Darnold risk**: Darnold had \"two months of middling football\" before his NFC Championship performance. He's also nursing an oblique injury. There's significant regression/variance risk with Darnold - he could easily revert to his middling form.\n\n9. **My current position**: I have 3244.7 YES shares and 7704.9 NO shares.

Let me think about what edges exist:\n\n**Drake Maye's shoulder/illness situation**: While he's confirmed to start, a QB who was limited all week with a shoulder injury and missed a session due to illness is not at 100%. Shoulder injuries affect throwing velocity, accuracy, and confidence. This is a real concern for the Patriots that the market at 50% may not fully reflect. In Super Bowls, quarterback health is paramount.\n\n**Seahawks adding two RBs**: This suggests they want to control the clock and run the ball, which is often a sound Super Bowl strategy - especially against a team whose QB might not be fully healthy. If Seattle can establish the run, they can limit New England's possessions and put less pressure on their own passing game.\n\n**The contrarian angle**: The market is perfectly split at 50%. Drake Maye's health issues during the week are a legitimate concern. A QB playing through a shoulder injury in the biggest game of his career, who also had an illness, is a meaningful negative for the Patriots. The market might be giving the Patriots too much credit by pricing this at exactly 50-50 when their QB has been banged up.\n\nI think Seattle has a slight edge here given Maye's health concerns. Maybe 53-55% for Seattle. At 50%, there's a small edge to buy YES (Seahawks). As a contrarian aggressive trader, I should act on this, but the edge isn't massive - it's a few percentage points at most.\n\nHowever, being aggressive and contrarian means I should take a meaningful position when I see an edge. The Maye injury news is real and could be underpriced.","raw":"<new_information>\nKey new developments:\n\n1. **Drake Maye health**: He was limited all last week with a shoulder injury and missed Friday's session with an illness, but CBS reports he's \"feeling great\" and practiced, and Marca confirms he's \"set to start Super Bowl LX after full practice week.\" So he's playing, but the shoulder concern is real - he was limited and sick during the week.\n\n2. **Seahawks roster moves**: Seattle is adding two running backs to their active roster for the Super Bowl, suggesting they're planning a run-heavy approach or have depth concerns at RB.\n\n3. **Patriots roster moves**: Patriots elevated two practice squad players to the active roster - this is the last transaction before the game.\n\n4. **Weather**: Mild conditions - 67°F high, cooling to low 50s in the evening. Outdoor game at Levi's Stadium. Good conditions, shouldn't significantly favor either team.\n\n5. **No major injury surprises** on either side beyond what was already known about Maye.\n</new_information>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe market is at 50-50, which is about as uncertain as it gets.
