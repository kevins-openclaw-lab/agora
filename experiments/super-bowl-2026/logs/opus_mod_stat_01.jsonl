When Maye has time, he can be extremely dangerous. One of the keys to his MVP-caliber season has been a willingness to make high-degree-of-difficulty throws. Overall, 17.3 percent of Maye’s attempts have been into tight windows—that’s the fourth-highest rate among starting quarterbacks. The Seahawks defense will challenge him.","url":"https://www.theringer.com/2026/02/02/nfl/super-bowl-60-cheat-sheet-22-things-to-know-about-patriots-vs-seahawks-drake-maye-sam-darnold"},{"title":"Super Bowl 2026: 60 facts to know for Seahawks vs. Patriots - CBS Sports","snippet":"Seattle has strong bookend tackles, but the interior offensive line is gettable, meaning Williams and Christian Barmore could have chances. 47.

Two of three games were very low-scoring, suggesting they're a defense-first team in the playoffs.\n- The Conference Championship was 10-7 - extremely tight, defensive game.\n- Seahawks have the better explosive-play differential overall.\n- Seahawks' interior offensive line is described as \"gettable\" - a potential weakness.\n\n**Market pricing analysis:**\nThe market has Seahawks at 57.7%. In a Super Bowl matchup, the typical spread between two teams that made it this far is often close. The Seahawks being favored at ~58% suggests they're probably favored by about 2-3 points.\n\nLooking at the data:\n- Seahawks appear to have the better overall team (better explosive-play differential, strong defense, dominant rushing)\n- Patriots have a strong QB in Maye and good defense but their playoff wins were grind-it-out affairs\n- The Seahawks' defensive strength against the Patriots' willingness to throw into tight windows creates an interesting matchup\n\nThe 57.7% price seems roughly fair for a team that's likely favored by a few points. In Super Bowls, home-field advantage doesn't apply, and the game is typically close. Historical Super Bowl data shows that favorites win roughly 55-60% of the time when favored by 2-3 points.\n\nGiven the Seahawks' superior explosive-play differential (best in NFL), strong defense, and dominant rushing game, I think 57.7% might be slightly low. The Seahawks seem like the more complete team. However, the Patriots' defensive playoff performances (allowing 3, 16, and 7 points) are impressive and suggest they could keep it close.\n\nI'd estimate fair value for Seahawks at around 58-60%. The current price of 57.7% is close to fair, maybe slightly undervalued for the Seahawks. This isn't a strong edge either way.\n\nGiven the small edge, I'll make a modest bet on YES (Seahawks) but keep it smaller since the edge is minimal.","raw":"<reasoning>\nLet me analyze the available statistics and data:\n\n**Seahawks strengths:**\n- Explosive-play differential of 4.7 percentage points (best in NFL, 9th-best historically)\n- Strong bookend tackles on offense\n- Strong defense that challenges quarterbacks\n- 339 total first downs vs 291 for opponents - solid offensive production\n- 125 rushing first downs vs opponents' 83 - dominant rushing attack\n\n**Patriots strengths:**\n- 4th in explosive-play differential at 2.8 percentage points\n- League-best explosive creation rate of 13.6% on offense\n- Drake Maye: 35 completions of 20+ yards (2nd in NFL), MVP-caliber season\n- 17.3% of attempts into tight windows (4th highest) - shows willingness to make difficult throws\n- Playoff path: Beat Chargers 16-3, Texans 28-16, Broncos 10-7 (won Conference Championship in a defensive battle)\n- 12-3 regular season record (at minimum, possibly better)\n\n**Key observations:**\n- Patriots' playoff path shows defensive dominance: 16-3, 28-16, 10-7.
