Sam Darnold has been inconsistent (\"two months of middling football\") but showed up big in the NFC Championship. He's dealing with an oblique injury but appears healthy enough to play.\n\n**Defensive Matchups:**\n- Seahawks defense: Ranked #1 by FPI. Five players with 40+ pressures.

Appears healthy enough but shoulder injuries on throwing arms are concerning for a QB.\n- Sam Darnold (oblique): Was nursing it but appears ready to go.\n- Patriots also have Harold Landry (knee) and Thayer Munford Jr. (knee) limited.\n\n**Historical Patterns:**\n- The #1 defense facing an elite passing offense is a classic Super Bowl dynamic. Historically, elite defenses tend to perform well in Super Bowls, but elite QBs/passing games can overcome them.\n- Mike Vrabel as a first-time Super Bowl head coach vs. Macdonald also relatively new - coaching edge is somewhat neutral, though Vrabel has Super Bowl experience as a player with the Patriots.\n\n**My Statistical Assessment:**\nThe market at 66.5% for Seattle seems roughly fair given the -4.5 spread. Converting a -4.5 spread to moneyline probability gives approximately 65-68% depending on the model. The FPI gap (7.0 vs 2.6) supports Seattle being a solid favorite.\n\nHowever, the Patriots' elite passing offense (3rd DVOA, 1st EPA/Dropback) against Seattle's #1 defense is the key matchup. The Patriots' weakness in the run game matters less if they can win through the air. But Seattle's pass rush depth (5 players with 40+ pressures) is designed to disrupt passing games.\n\nThe fact that 82.8% of experts picked Seattle while the line is only -4.5 suggests the market may be slightly underpricing Seattle, but not dramatically. The expert consensus is higher than what the line implies.\n\n**Key concern for Patriots:** Red zone defense weakness + Drake Maye's shoulder. If Maye's shoulder limits him at all, the Patriots' elite passing game could be significantly diminished.\n\n**My estimate:** I'd put Seattle's win probability at around 67-70%. The market at 66.5% is very close to fair, perhaps slightly underpricing Seattle by 1-3 percentage points.\n\nGiven that the edge is small (maybe 1-3%), this doesn't warrant a large bet.

He had a shoulder injury limiting him all week and missed a practice due to illness. While he's reportedly \"feeling great\" and will start, there's a meaningful question about whether he's truly 100%. A QB playing through a shoulder injury could have diminished arm strength or accuracy, which would favor the Seahawks.\n\nHowever, the market at 42.1% Seahawks (57.9% Patriots) likely already has some of this priced in, since the Maye injury news has been circulating throughout the week. The fact that he completed a full practice week and is confirmed to start mitigates some concern.\n\nThe Seahawks adding two running backs suggests they may lean on the ground game, which could be a smart strategy if they believe the Patriots defense is vulnerable there or if weather conditions (cooling evening temps) favor a run-heavy approach.\n\nOverall assessment: The Maye shoulder/illness situation is somewhat concerning for the Patriots but appears largely priced in. The market at 42.1% Seahawks seems reasonable. If anything, the residual risk of Maye's shoulder affecting his performance in-game (even if he starts) might make the Seahawks slightly undervalued - perhaps fair value is closer to 44-45%. But this is a marginal edge at best.\n\nGiven my existing position (net long Seahawks with 5857.9 YES vs 4267.7 NO), I already have exposure to a Seahawks win. The new information slightly favors the Seahawks (Maye injury concerns, Seahawks bolstering their roster), but not enough to warrant a large additional trade. A small additional YES position could be warranted given the Maye health uncertainty that may not be fully priced in.","raw":"<new_information>\nKey new information found:\n\n1. **Drake Maye status**: He was limited all last week with a shoulder injury and missed Friday's session with an illness. However, the latest reports say he's \"feeling great\" and had a full practice week, and is set to start Super Bowl LX. This suggests he's playing but may not be 100%.\n\n2. **Seahawks roster moves**: Seattle is adding two running backs to their active roster for Super Bowl LX. This could indicate a game plan emphasizing the run, or it could be depth insurance. Not hugely material but suggests they want running back depth.\n\n3. **Patriots roster moves**: Patriots elevated two practice squad players to the active roster - this is standard procedure and likely not material.\n\n4. **Weather**: Mild conditions - high of 67°F, cooling to low 50s in the evening. Outdoor game at Levi's Stadium. These are near-ideal football conditions and shouldn't significantly favor either team.\n\n5. **No major surprise inactives or scratches** have been reported yet (the inactive list typically comes out 90 minutes before kickoff).\n</new_information>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe most material piece of information is Drake Maye's health situation.
