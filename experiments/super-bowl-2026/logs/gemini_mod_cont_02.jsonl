Phrases like \"One-Way Traffic on Seattle\" and reports that sharp money moved the line to -4.5 indicate a strong consensus.

The fact that the \"Seahawks gave up 12 explosives to the Rams in the NFC Championship Game\" is a critical piece of information. A defense prone to giving up big plays is a significant liability in a championship game, especially against a well-coached Patriots team that can exploit matchups.\n\nThird, the Patriots are being underestimated.
