New England's playoff defense has been lights-out, surrendering just 6 explosives across three games vs. compromised offenses, and they can play conservative coverages to force Darnold (oblique-limited, inconsistent post-injury) into mistakes while exploiting Seattle's 11th-ranked defense in key spots. Drake Maye is fully healthy (shoulder full participant, \"feeling good\"), Pats OL holds up in 1-on-1s with depth EDGE rush, and their red zone offense can capitalize on New England's own RZ weaknesses flipped against Seattle's conservative scheme.
