ESPN Analytics gives Seattle a 60.2% chance to win.\n\nKey observations:\n\n1. **The market is overpriced relative to sharp money indicators.** The prediction market has Seahawks at 65%, but ESPN Analytics puts them at 60.2%. Sportsbooks have the line at -4.5, which typically implies roughly 60-63% win probability for the favorite.
