Key statistical strengths for New England:\n\n- **Elite passing offense**: Patriots rank 3rd in overall DVOA, 2nd in Pass DVOA, 1st in EPA/dropback, and 1st in success rate (59%). This directly counters Seattle's #1 defense, which excels in pass rush depth (5 players >40 pressures) but faces an offense that doesn't require a perfect O-line—Pats can win through dropback efficiency even vs. top defenses.\n- **Playoff defense peaking**: Allowed just 6 explosives over 3 postseason games (vs. compromised offenses), ranking 11th regular-season but showing matchup-specific upside. Seahawks allowed 12 explosives to the Rams in the NFC Championship despite winning—vulnerability to Pats' conservative split-safety scheme that limits big plays.\n- **QB health edge**: Drake Maye full participant, shoulder \"all good,\" no limitations. Sam Darnold nursing oblique injury, potentially limiting mobility/responses under pressure.\n- **Rankings balance**: Pats #10 FPI (2.6), 9th offense, 11th defense—highly competitive vs. Seattle's 11th offense. Red zone exploitation possible given Pats' pass efficiency.\n- **Market blind spots**: Vegas spread -4.5 (implied ~65-68% Sea) but sharp money split (Sea spread, Pats +190 ML); expert models/hot streaks (Darnold's 1-game outlier) may overrate Sea. Pats underdogs for reason but 9th offense vs. 11th Sea defense creates value at 39.3% implied NO prob—true odds closer to 40-45% given Pats' DVOA edges and Vrabel coaching.\nCrowd wrong on overconfidence in Sea's metrics without adjusting for Pats' postseason surge and O-D matchup parity.\n</contrarian_case>\n\n<reasoning>\nContrarian case is credible—Pats' pass offense metrics (top DVOA/EPA) pose real threat to Sea D, playoff D sample favors NE, injury asymmetry favors Maye, and agent cascade likely inflated Sea from early anchors.
