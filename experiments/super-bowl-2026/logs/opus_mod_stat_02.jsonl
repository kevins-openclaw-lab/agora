Their run game is weak (21st DVOA). This is a pass-first team.\n- Seahawks offense: 11th ranked. Sam Darnold has been inconsistent but showed up big in the NFC Championship. He's been nursing an oblique injury but appears healthy.\n\n**Defensive Matchups:**\n- Seahawks defense: Ranked #1 overall. Five pass rushers with 40+ pressures each (Lawrence, Murphy II, Nwosu, Williams, Mafe). Strengths are DT room, slot corner, and box safety. Macdonald's inside-out defensive philosophy.\n- Patriots defense: 11th ranked, ordinary by advanced metrics during regular season. Red zone defense was one of their biggest weaknesses. However, they've allowed just 6 explosive plays through 3 postseason games (though against compromised offenses).\n\n**Key Injury Analysis:**\n- Drake Maye: Right shoulder injury on his throwing arm. Full participant for 3 straight days, so he's playing. But shoulder injuries on a throwing arm can limit velocity and accuracy, especially under pressure from Seattle's elite pass rush.\n- Sam Darnold: Oblique injury, appears healthy enough to play.\n- Patriots: Harold Landry (knee) and Thayer Munford Jr. (knee) both limited.\n\n**Statistical Profile:**\n- FPI: Seahawks #1 (7.0) vs Patriots #10 (2.6) - significant gap\n- ATS records: Seattle 14-5, New England 13-6-1\n- Spread: Seahawks -4.5, which implies roughly 63-65% win probability\n- Expert picks: 82.8% picking Seahawks (48 of 58 experts)\n- Sharp money moved the line from -3 to -4.5 on Seattle\n\n**Coaching:**\n- Mike Macdonald (Seahawks): Defensive mastermind, #1 defense\n- Mike Vrabel (Patriots): Experienced, player-turned-coach, seeking 7th franchise Super Bowl\n\n**Key Matchup Analysis:**\nThe critical question: Can the Patriots' elite passing attack (1st EPA/Dropback) overcome the Seahawks' #1 defense with its deep pass rush rotation? \n\nThe Patriots are pass-dependent (21st run DVOA) which plays into Seattle's strength. Seattle's five-deep pass rush rotation against a Patriots OL that \"doesn't have to be perfect\" is concerning for New England. Drake Maye's shoulder injury compounds this - even if he's playing, facing constant pressure with a compromised throwing shoulder is problematic.\n\nThe Patriots' defensive weakness in the red zone is also critical. If Seattle can move the ball and convert in the red zone, New England's defense may not hold up.\n\n**Historical Patterns:**\nTeams with #1 ranked defenses historically perform well in Super Bowls. Pass-rush depth wears down offensive lines over 4 quarters. The team with the better defense tends to win more often than not in the Super Bowl.\n\n**My Assessment:**\nThe Seahawks have clear advantages:\n- #1 overall defense vs a pass-dependent offense\n- Elite pass rush depth vs a QB with a shoulder injury\n- Higher FPI rating (7.0 vs 2.6)\n- Sharp money and expert consensus favor Seattle\n- Home-field-like advantage with 82.8% expert backing\n\nThe spread of -4.5 implies roughly a 63-65% Seahawks win probability. The market is at 68.7%. Expert consensus is at 82.8%. \n\nGiven the statistical profile - #1 defense, #1 FPI, elite pass rush vs compromised QB shoulder, weak Patriots red zone defense - I think the true probability is somewhere around 65-70%. The market at 68.7% seems roughly fair, perhaps slightly high but within a reasonable range.\n\nMy current position has both YES and NO shares (3372.6 YES, 7412.6 NO), so I'm somewhat hedged but leaning NO. Given that the statistics support the Seahawks at roughly the current market price, and I think 68.7% is approximately fair (maybe slightly high at 67% true probability), there's not a huge edge either way.\n\nHowever, looking more carefully: the FPI gap is substantial (7.0 vs 2.6), the #1 defense facing a pass-dependent team with a QB nursing a shoulder injury is a significant edge. The pass rush depth wearing down over 4 quarters is real. I'd put the true probability at about 66-68%, which means the market at 68.7% is very close to fair.\n\nGiven my existing position is heavier on NO shares (7412.6 NO vs 3372.6 YES), and I think the market is roughly fair, I should consider whether to balance my position or hold. Since 68.7% is close to my estimate, I'll HOLD this round.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. My NO position is much larger than my YES position. If I think the true probability is ~67%, and the market is at 68.7%, NO shares are slightly underpriced. But the edge is very small (1-2%). Given the small edge, I should hold rather than add to either side.","raw":"<reasoning>\nLet me break down this matchup systematically using the data available.\n\n**Offensive Matchups:**\n- Patriots offense: 3rd in DVOA, 2nd in Pass DVOA, 1st in EPA/Dropback and Success Rate (59%).

But shoulder injuries on a throwing arm can limit velocity and accuracy, especially under pressure from Seattle's elite pass rush.\n- Sam Darnold: Oblique injury, appears healthy enough to play.\n- Patriots: Harold Landry (knee) and Thayer Munford Jr. (knee) both limited.\n\n**Statistical Profile:**\n- FPI: Seahawks #1 (7.0) vs Patriots #10 (2.6) - significant gap\n- ATS records: Seattle 14-5, New England 13-6-1\n- Spread: Seahawks -4.5, which implies roughly 63-65% win probability\n- Expert picks: 82.8% picking Seahawks (48 of 58 experts)\n- Sharp money moved the line from -3 to -4.5 on Seattle\n\n**Coaching:**\n- Mike Macdonald (Seahawks): Defensive mastermind, #1 defense\n- Mike Vrabel (Patriots): Experienced, player-turned-coach, seeking 7th franchise Super Bowl\n\n**Key Matchup Analysis:**\nThe critical question: Can the Patriots' elite passing attack (1st EPA/Dropback) overcome the Seahawks' #1 defense with its deep pass rush rotation? \n\nThe Patriots are pass-dependent (21st run DVOA) which plays into Seattle's strength. Seattle's five-deep pass rush rotation against a Patriots OL that \"doesn't have to be perfect\" is concerning for New England. Drake Maye's shoulder injury compounds this - even if he's playing, facing constant pressure with a compromised throwing shoulder is problematic.\n\nThe Patriots' defensive weakness in the red zone is also critical. If Seattle can move the ball and convert in the red zone, New England's defense may not hold up.\n\n**Historical Patterns:**\nTeams with #1 ranked defenses historically perform well in Super Bowls. Pass-rush depth wears down offensive lines over 4 quarters. The team with the better defense tends to win more often than not in the Super Bowl.\n\n**My Assessment:**\nThe Seahawks have clear advantages:\n- #1 overall defense vs a pass-dependent offense\n- Elite pass rush depth vs a QB with a shoulder injury\n- Higher FPI rating (7.0 vs 2.6)\n- Sharp money and expert consensus favor Seattle\n- Home-field-like advantage with 82.8% expert backing\n\nThe spread of -4.5 implies roughly a 63-65% Seahawks win probability. The market is at 68.7%. Expert consensus is at 82.8%. \n\nGiven the statistical profile - #1 defense, #1 FPI, elite pass rush vs compromised QB shoulder, weak Patriots red zone defense - I think the true probability is somewhere around 65-70%. The market at 68.7% seems roughly fair, perhaps slightly high but within a reasonable range.\n\nMy current position has both YES and NO shares (3372.6 YES, 7412.6 NO), so I'm somewhat hedged but leaning NO. Given that the statistics support the Seahawks at roughly the current market price, and I think 68.7% is approximately fair (maybe slightly high at 67% true probability), there's not a huge edge either way.\n\nHowever, looking more carefully: the FPI gap is substantial (7.0 vs 2.6), the #1 defense facing a pass-dependent team with a QB nursing a shoulder injury is a significant edge. The pass rush depth wearing down over 4 quarters is real. I'd put the true probability at about 66-68%, which means the market at 68.7% is very close to fair.\n\nGiven my existing position is heavier on NO shares (7412.6 NO vs 3372.6 YES), and I think the market is roughly fair, I should consider whether to balance my position or hold. Since 68.7% is close to my estimate, I'll HOLD this round.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. My NO position is much larger than my YES position. If I think the true probability is ~67%, and the market is at 68.7%, NO shares are slightly underpriced. But the edge is very small (1-2%). Given the small edge, I should hold rather than add to either side.\n</reasoning>\n\n<decision>\nACTION: HOLD\nAMOUNT: 0\nCONFIDENCE: MEDIUM\n</decision>"},"trade_result":null}

This suggests he's playing but may not be 100%.\n\n2. **Seahawks roster moves**: Seattle is adding two running backs to their active roster for Super Bowl LX. This could indicate they plan to lean on the run game, or it could be depth insurance. Not necessarily a major signal either way.\n\n3. **Patriots roster moves**: Patriots elevated two practice squad players to the active roster - this is standard Super Bowl procedure.\n\n4. **Weather**: Mild conditions - high of 67°F, cooling to low 50s in the evening. This is neutral/favorable for both teams. No weather advantage for either side at Levi's Stadium (outdoor venue).\n\n5. **No major injury surprises**: No reports of key players being ruled out unexpectedly for either team.\n</new_information>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe most material piece of information is Drake Maye's health situation.
