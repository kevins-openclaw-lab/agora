When Maye has time, he can be extremely dangerous. One of the keys to his MVP-caliber season has been a willingness to make high-degree-of-difficulty throws. Overall, 17.3 percent of Maye’s attempts have been into tight windows—that’s the fourth-highest rate among starting quarterbacks. The Seahawks defense will challenge him.","url":"https://www.theringer.com/2026/02/02/nfl/super-bowl-60-cheat-sheet-22-things-to-know-about-patriots-vs-seahawks-drake-maye-sam-darnold"},{"title":"Super Bowl 2026: 60 facts to know for Seahawks vs. Patriots - CBS Sports","snippet":"Seattle has strong bookend tackles, but the interior offensive line is gettable, meaning Williams and Christian Barmore could have chances. 47.

The Patriots' playoff path shows defensive dominance - holding opponents to 3, 16, and 7 points. That's an average of 8.7 points allowed per playoff game. This is elite defensive performance.\n2. However, their offensive output in playoffs was also modest: 16, 28, 10 points scored. The Conference Championship was a grind-it-out 10-7 win.\n3. Seattle's explosive-play differential being the best in the NFL suggests they're both creating big plays and preventing them - a strong indicator of overall team quality.\n4. The market has Seahawks at 56%, which is a slight favorite.\n\n**Historical Super Bowl considerations:**\n- Super Bowls are typically close games. A 56/44 split seems reasonable for any Super Bowl matchup.\n- The Patriots' defensive playoff performance is impressive but their offense looked inconsistent (10 points in the AFC Championship).\n- Seattle's overall statistical profile (best explosive-play differential) suggests they're the more complete team.\n\n**Assessment:**\nThe Seahawks being at 56% seems roughly fair. Their explosive-play differential being the best in the NFL is a strong statistical indicator. The Patriots have shown they can win ugly with defense, but their offensive inconsistency in the playoffs (especially only 10 points in the AFCCG) is concerning.\n\nHowever, I think the market might be slightly undervaluing the Seahawks. The best explosive-play differential in the NFL historically correlates well with Super Bowl success. Seattle's defense being able to challenge Maye, combined with their offensive capability, suggests they should be favored by perhaps a bit more than 56%.\n\nThat said, the Patriots' playoff defensive dominance is real, and Super Bowls are inherently uncertain. I'd put the Seahawks' true probability around 55-58%, so the market at 56% is close to fair.\n\nGiven that my estimate is roughly in line with the market (maybe very slightly favoring Seahawks at ~57-58%), I could make a small YES bet, but the edge is thin. A moderate position seems appropriate given the small perceived edge.\n\nI'll make a modest YES bet since I think the Seahawks' statistical profile (best explosive-play differential, strong defense) gives them a slight edge that might be marginally underpriced at 56%.","raw":"<reasoning>\nLet me analyze the available data systematically.\n\n**Seattle Seahawks:**\n- Strong explosive-play differential (4.7 percentage points, best in NFL, 9th-best historically)\n- Strong bookend tackles but vulnerable interior offensive line\n- Strong defense that challenges quarterbacks\n- 339 total first downs vs 291 for opponents - solid offensive advantage\n- Their defense appears to be aggressive, which can be exploited but is generally effective\n\n**New England Patriots:**\n- 4th in explosive-play differential at 2.8 percentage points\n- League-best explosive creation rate of 13.6% on offense\n- Drake Maye had an MVP-caliber season\n- 35 completions of 20+ yards (2nd in NFL)\n- 17.3% of attempts into tight windows (4th highest)\n- Playoff path: Beat Chargers 16-3, Texans 28-16, Broncos 10-7\n- Regular season: 12-3 or better (at minimum based on the data shown)\n\n**Key observations:**\n1.
