However, he did tell the Boston Herald earlier in the day that he&#x27;s &quot;100% confident&quot; that he&#x27;ll be able to play in Super Bowl LX. Meanwhile, linebacker Harold Landry (knee) and offensive tackle Thayer Munford Jr. were both limited with knee injuries. Maybe the most important development on the injury front for New England comes at quarterback as the team listed Drake Maye (right shoulder) as a full participant.","url":"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/super-bowl-lx-injury-report-updates-on-drake-mayes-right-shoulder-sam-darnolds-oblique-more/"}]}],"decision":{"action":"BUY_YES","amount":537,"confidence":"HIGH","reasoning":"The confirmation of a fully healthy Drake Maye is objectively good news for the Patriots and bad news for the Seahawks.

After being limited with a shoulder injury and missing a practice with illness, Maye was a full participant in the final practices and is reported to be \"feeling great.\" This removes any lingering uncertainty about his health for the game.\n\nFor the Seahawks, while their injury report lists several players, they had \"perfect attendance\" at practice. Many key players listed (Demarcus Lawrence, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Leonard Williams) were for rest, which is standard. While some offensive linemen (Charles Cross, Josh Jones) are nursing injuries, they were participants, suggesting they will play.\n\nThe weather forecast is for mild, clear conditions, which is not a factor. Roster elevations on both sides are minor and typical pre-game moves.\n</new_information>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe confirmation of a fully healthy Drake Maye is objectively good news for the Patriots and bad news for the Seahawks.
