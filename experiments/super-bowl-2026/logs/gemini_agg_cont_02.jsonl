The fact that their defense, which is getting \"all the hype,\" gave up **12 explosive plays** to the Rams in their last game is a massive red flag. That's not the sign of an unbeatable team; it's the sign of a team with a potentially fatal flaw that the Patriots can exploit.\n\nSecond, the underdog Patriots are being underestimated. The narrative suggests their defense is \"quietly just as good\" as Seattle's. In a Super Bowl, a strong, underrated defense against a hyped-up, potentially vulnerable opponent is the classic recipe for an upset.\n\nThird, the market price (65.2%) is higher than at least one analytical model (ESPN at 60.2%). This suggests the public has pushed the price beyond what a more sober analysis would indicate. While some reports mention \"sharps\" moving the line towards Seattle, another source states that significant sharp action \"hasn't happened yet.\" This ambiguity suggests the current price is driven more by public sentiment than by a consensus of professional bettors.\n\nThe crowd sees a 4.5-point favorite and is piling on.
