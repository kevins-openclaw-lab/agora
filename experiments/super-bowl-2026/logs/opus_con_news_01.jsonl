The Patriots' elite passing offense (1st in EPA/Dropback) against Seattle's #1 defense is the key matchup, and elite passing attacks can overcome great defenses. The Patriots' red zone defense weakness could be exploited by Seattle's offense.\n\nThe market at 66.6% is reasonably close to fair value based on the spread, but I think it's slightly underpricing Seattle given:\n- Sharp money moving to -4.5\n- 82.8% expert consensus\n- #1 defense vs a passing attack that hasn't faced this caliber of defense\n- Patriots' defensive weaknesses in the red zone\n- Seahawks' superior overall FPI rating (7.0 vs 2.6)\n\nI'd put fair value for Seahawks around 68-70%. The market at 66.6% offers a small edge on YES.\n\n**Position consideration:** I already have 3543.6 YES shares and 7055.0 NO shares. This is a somewhat hedged position.

I'm slightly bullish on Seahawks.\n\n**Market Price:** 48.9% Seahawks (51.1% Patriots implied)\n\n**Key Facts from Research:**\n1. **FPI:** Seahawks #1 (7.0) vs Patriots #10 (2.6) - significant edge to Seattle\n2. **Defense:** Seahawks #1 overall defense, Patriots #11\n3. **Betting line:** Seahawks -4.5, money line -230 (implies ~70% win probability)\n4. **Expert consensus:** 82.8% of 58 ESPN experts pick Seahawks (48-10)\n5. **Sharp money:** Line moved from -3 to -4.5 on Seattle - sharps backing Seahawks\n6. **Patriots offense:** Elite passing (#3 DVOA, #1 EPA/dropback, 59% success rate)\n7. **Injuries:** Maye's shoulder appears fine (full participant). Darnold had oblique concern.\n8. **Patriots red zone defense:** One of their biggest weaknesses\n9. **Seahawks pass rush depth:** 5 players with 40+ pressures\n\n**Market History Analysis:**\nThe market started at 50%, moved to 63-73% Seahawks when agents had search access (Rounds 1-2), then dropped to ~49% in the blind round when agents couldn't search and relied on priors. Now at 48.9% with search restored.\n\nThis is very telling. When agents have access to actual data about this matchup, the price moves toward Seahawks. When they're blind, it reverts toward 50/50 or slightly below (because historical priors about these franchises favor Patriots dynasty narrative).\n\n**The Critical Disconnect:**\nThe market is at 48.9% Seahawks, but:\n- Vegas has Seahawks at -4.5 (implying ~67% win probability)\n- 83% of ESPN experts pick Seahawks\n- FPI strongly favors Seahawks\n- Seahawks have #1 defense vs a pass-heavy Patriots team\n\nThe market at 48.9% is dramatically underpricing the Seahawks relative to every external indicator. This is likely because:\n1. Many contrarian agents are aggressively fading the Seahawks consensus\n2. The blind round dragged the price down and it hasn't recovered\n3. Some agents are overweighting Patriots' elite passing metrics while underweighting Seahawks' elite defense\n\n**Agent Analysis:**\n- The Grok contrarian/aggressive agents are heavily pushing NO, arguing Seahawks are overvalued\n- The statistical agents generally find Seahawks at 55-60% true probability\n- The sentiment agents note overwhelming pro-Seahawks sentiment\n- Even conservative estimates put Seahawks at ~55-58%\n\n**My Assessment:**\nThe Seahawks are the clear favorite based on all available evidence. The betting market (which aggregates billions in real money) has them at -4.5 / -230 ML, implying roughly 67-70% win probability. Even being conservative and discounting that significantly, I'd put the Seahawks at 57-62%.\n\nAt 48.9%, YES is significantly underpriced. The edge is roughly 8-13 percentage points.\n\n**Trade Decision:**\nAs a conservative, news-focused forecaster, I should buy YES but in measured amounts. My balance is 2275 AGP. A 10% bet would be ~227 AGP. Given the size of the apparent mispricing (8-13 points), I'll go slightly larger but still conservative - about 10% of bankroll.\n\nThe news is clear: Maye's shoulder is fine, Darnold's oblique is a minor concern, the matchup data strongly favors Seattle, and the betting market agrees.

When they're blind, it reverts toward 50/50 or slightly below (because historical priors about these franchises favor Patriots dynasty narrative).\n\n**The Critical Disconnect:**\nThe market is at 48.9% Seahawks, but:\n- Vegas has Seahawks at -4.5 (implying ~67% win probability)\n- 83% of ESPN experts pick Seahawks\n- FPI strongly favors Seahawks\n- Seahawks have #1 defense vs a pass-heavy Patriots team\n\nThe market at 48.9% is dramatically underpricing the Seahawks relative to every external indicator. This is likely because:\n1. Many contrarian agents are aggressively fading the Seahawks consensus\n2. The blind round dragged the price down and it hasn't recovered\n3. Some agents are overweighting Patriots' elite passing metrics while underweighting Seahawks' elite defense\n\n**Agent Analysis:**\n- The Grok contrarian/aggressive agents are heavily pushing NO, arguing Seahawks are overvalued\n- The statistical agents generally find Seahawks at 55-60% true probability\n- The sentiment agents note overwhelming pro-Seahawks sentiment\n- Even conservative estimates put Seahawks at ~55-58%\n\n**My Assessment:**\nThe Seahawks are the clear favorite based on all available evidence. The betting market (which aggregates billions in real money) has them at -4.5 / -230 ML, implying roughly 67-70% win probability. Even being conservative and discounting that significantly, I'd put the Seahawks at 57-62%.\n\nAt 48.9%, YES is significantly underpriced. The edge is roughly 8-13 percentage points.\n\n**Trade Decision:**\nAs a conservative, news-focused forecaster, I should buy YES but in measured amounts. My balance is 2275 AGP. A 10% bet would be ~227 AGP. Given the size of the apparent mispricing (8-13 points), I'll go slightly larger but still conservative - about 10% of bankroll.\n\nThe news is clear: Maye's shoulder is fine, Darnold's oblique is a minor concern, the matchup data strongly favors Seattle, and the betting market agrees. The prediction market at 48.9% is a significant outlier compared to all other pricing mechanisms.\n</reasoning>\n\n<decision>\nACTION: BUY_YES\nAMOUNT: 225\nCONFIDENCE: HIGH\nFOLLOWED_CROWD: PARTIALLY\n</decision>"},"trade_result":{"success":true,"trade":{"id":"5520d26b-bd79-4238-b8a8-9b2ec53f6a12","outcome":"yes","amount":225,"shares":221.377613337605,"avg_price":0.9982942568947605,"fee":4},"market":{"id":"ef0707a4-25a7-4fc0-984c-1d8098d0debf","question":"Will the Seattle Seahawks win Super Bowl LX?","description":"🧪 AI PREDICTION EXPERIMENT: 80 AI agents from 4 frontier labs (Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-5.2, Gemini 2.5, Grok 4.1) are trading on this market.

However, the Marca headline says \"Drake Maye injury update: Patriots QB set to start Super Bowl LX after full practice week.\" This is slightly contradictory - he was limited but apparently practiced enough to be cleared. The CBS Boston article notes he was \"feeling great\" at the first official practice. This suggests he's playing but may not be 100%.\n\n2. **Seahawks roster moves**: Seattle is adding two running backs to their active roster for Super Bowl LX. This suggests they're planning to lean on the run game, which could indicate confidence in their game plan or compensating for something.\n\n3. **Patriots roster moves**: Patriots elevated two practice squad players to the active roster - this is the last roster transaction before the game.\n\n4. **Weather**: Mild conditions - 67°F high, cooling to low 50s in the evening. Outdoor game at Levi's Stadium. This is neutral/favorable weather - shouldn't significantly impact either team.\n\n5. **No major injury scratches or surprise inactives reported yet** - the inactive list doesn't appear to have been released yet (game is at 6:30 PM ET, inactives typically come out 90 minutes before).\n</new_information>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe most material piece of information is Drake Maye's health.
