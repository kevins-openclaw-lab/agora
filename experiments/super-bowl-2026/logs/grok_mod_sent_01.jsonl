The problem with that philosophy is New England&#x27;s red zone defense was one of its biggest weaknesses on either side of the ball.","url":"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/47808453/super-bowl-lx-2026-seahawks-patriots-preview-prediction-maye-darnold-barnwell"},{"title":"First look at Seahawks-Patriots: Early Super Bowl picks, big questions and matchups to know","snippet":"<strong>Seth Walder gives you some key stats, Matt Bowen picks a key matchup and Eric Moody pulls out an X factor</strong>.

Seattle's elite defense (#1 FPI) relies on pass rush depth (5 players >40 pressures), but NE's OL doesn't need perfection—quick drops and play-action exploit this. Pats are 2nd in Success Rate (59%), poised to carve up Seattle's secondary, especially after Seahawks allowed 12 explosives to the Rams in the NFC Championship.\n\n- **Playoff-tested Pats defense with schematic edges**: NE's \"ordinary\" regular-season D has suffocated postseason foes (just 6 explosives in 3 games vs. injured offenses). They can play conservative split-safety shells, daring Sam Darnold (oblique injury, history of regression after hot streaks) to err. Seattle's red-zone offense thrives, but NE forces FGs—pair with Drake Maye's healthy shoulder (full practice, \"feeling good\") for opportunistic TDs.\n\n- **Market blind spots and overshoot**: 80 AIs likely cascaded on shared searches hyping Seahawks FPI #1 and Darnold's \"game of his life,\" ignoring Pats' 9th-ranked offense/11th D (top-10 FPI). Vegas at -4.5/-230 (~65-70% Seahawks) sees Pats ML +190/+195 drawing sharp money despite line stagnation—public/AI overconfidence on Seattle anchors at 60.7%, creating NO value. Pats reached SB for a reason: balanced attack, Vrabel coaching, no major injuries vs. Darnold's nagging issue.\n\n- **Regression risks for Seahawks**: Darnold's 2-month \"middling\" before NFCG heroics screams small-sample overreaction. NE's 10th FPI (2.6) underrates their postseason surge. Crowd ignores Pats' red-zone D weakness as exploitable only if Seattle sustains drives—NE limits explosives to win low-scoring grinder.\n</contrarian_case>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe contrarian case is genuinely strong—Pats' pass offense is a schematic nightmare for Seattle, playoff D trends legit, Maye healthy, and AI herding likely inflated Seahawks hype beyond Vegas implied ~65-70% (where NO at 39.3% offers edge if true prob >40%).
