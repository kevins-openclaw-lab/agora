The Marca headline confirms he's \"set to start Super Bowl LX after full practice week.\" This suggests he's healthy enough to play but there were real concerns earlier in the week.\n\n2. **Seahawks roster moves**: Seattle is adding two running backs to their active roster for Super Bowl LX. This suggests they're bolstering their ground game, possibly due to injuries at the position or a strategic decision to run more.\n\n3. **Patriots roster moves**: Patriots have elevated two practice squad players to the active roster - the last roster transaction before the game.\n\n4. **Weather**: Mild conditions - 67°F high, cooling to low 50s in the evening. Outdoor game at Levi's Stadium. Pleasant conditions that shouldn't significantly favor either team.\n\n5. **No major surprise injuries or scratches reported** - no bombshell inactive list news yet (game hasn't started, inactives typically released ~90 minutes before kickoff at ~5:00 PM ET).\n</new_information>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe market is at 51.9% Seahawks, essentially a coin flip with slight Seahawks lean.\n\nAnalyzing the new information:\n- Drake Maye's shoulder/illness situation was a concern but appears resolved.
