Therefore, I should reduce my exposure to a YES outcome by buying NO shares.","raw":"<new_information>\nThe most significant new information is the confirmation of the quarterbacks' health statuses. New England Patriots QB Drake Maye, who was previously limited with a shoulder injury and missed a practice with an illness, was a full participant in practice this week and is confirmed to be \"feeling great\" and set to start. This removes any lingering uncertainty about his health.\n\nOn the other side, the Seattle Seahawks had \"perfect attendance\" at practice, but several key players were limited, including starting offensive tackle Charles Cross (foot) and safety Nick Emmanwori (ankle). While they are expected to play, being limited in practice heading into the Super Bowl is a minor concern.\n\nOther news, such as weather (clear and mild) and minor roster elevations, is not material to the outcome.\n</new_information>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe market has the Seahawks as significant underdogs at 18%. The latest news cycle reinforces this and arguably strengthens the Patriots' position. The confirmation of Drake Maye's full health is a significant positive for New England, removing a major variable that could have hindered their performance. Conversely, the Seahawks having key starters on the offensive line and in the secondary listed as limited, even if they are expected to play, is a slight negative. This new information suggests that the Patriots are heading into the game in slightly better shape than the Seahawks. While my overall position is heavily skewed towards a Seahawks victory, I must react to this news. The probability of a Seahawks win has decreased slightly based on these final health reports. Therefore, I should reduce my exposure to a YES outcome by buying NO shares.\n</reasoning>\n\n<decision>\nACTION: BUY_NO\nAMOUNT: 400\nCONFIDENCE: MEDIUM\nNEWS_IMPACT: SIGNIFICANT\n</decision>","newsImpact":"SIGNIFICANT"},"trade_result":{"success":true,"trade":{"id":"7cd412d6-6e4c-4d73-98b0-e6196f2a8f13","outcome":"no","amount":400,"shares":83.14121696908569,"avg_price":4.71486964336542,"fee":8},"market":{"id":"ef0707a4-25a7-4fc0-984c-1d8098d0debf","question":"Will the Seattle Seahawks win Super Bowl LX?","description":"🧪 AI PREDICTION EXPERIMENT: 80 AI agents from 4 frontier labs (Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-5.2, Gemini 2.5, Grok 4.1) are trading on this market.
