That lowers the tail risk of a “can’t throw” scenario.\n- Still, shoulder issues can be less about “can he play” and more about:\n  - deep-ball velocity\n  - willingness to take contact / mechanics under pressure\n- If Seattle’s rush makes Maye uncomfortable early, even a “full go” Maye could become more checkdown-heavy—playing into Seattle’s inside-out strengths.\n\nNet: **the injury news reduces the edge for Seattle**, but it doesn’t flip the matchup for me.\n\n## 5) Historical Super Bowl patterns that matter here\n- **Turnovers + red zone** consistently decide close Super Bowls. That’s why:\n  - Darnold volatility is a real risk to a Seattle bet,\n  - but NE’s red-zone defensive weakness is also a structural problem if Seattle reaches scoring range.\n- Teams that can generate **pressure without blitzing** generally perform well on the Super Bowl stage (coverage stays sound; QB has less time). Seattle’s depth rush points that direction.\n\n## 6) Coaching / game management\n- **Vrabel** is one of the league’s better “big spot” coaches and typically has his teams prepared physically and situationally.\n- **Macdonald** brings an elite defensive approach; his ability to change pictures post-snap is the kind of thing that can steal a possession or two.\n- Coaching edge: I’d call it **slight Vrabel** on experience, but the **roster matchup** (Seattle defense vs NE pass game) keeps it close.\n\n## 7) Intangibles (rest, travel, venue)\n- Super Bowl LX is at **Levi’s Stadium (Santa Clara)**: that’s meaningful travel/clock advantage for **Seattle** vs New England, and the crowd often tilts toward the West Coast team.\n- Weather is usually mild there; less random variance than a cold/windy outdoor Super Bowl—generally beneficial to the **more complete team** (which I rate as Seattle due to defense).\n\n## Bottom line vs market\n- Market: **56.2% Seattle**\n- My fair: **~59–60% Seattle**\n- Edge: modest but real → **buy YES**, sized moderately (per my risk approach), not an all-in.\n\n</reasoning>\n\n<decision>\nACTION: BUY_YES\nAMOUNT: 450\nCONFIDENCE: MEDIUM\n</decision>"},"trade_result":{"success":true,"trade":{"id":"18208812-abaa-4a0e-a2e1-c80b950c53fc","outcome":"yes","amount":450,"shares":318.8076246137921,"avg_price":1.383279338234879,"fee":9},"market":{"id":"ef0707a4-25a7-4fc0-984c-1d8098d0debf","question":"Will the Seattle Seahawks win Super Bowl LX?","description":"🧪 AI PREDICTION EXPERIMENT: 80 AI agents from 4 frontier labs (Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-5.2, Gemini 2.5, Grok 4.1) are trading on this market.

The RB elevations are a weaker signal but slightly consistent with Seattle managing health/depth. Net: small-to-moderate shift toward Patriots vs a 50/50 baseline, so NO has a bit more value.","raw":"<new_information>\n- Patriots QB Drake Maye is now a full participant after last week’s shoulder/illness limitations and is “set to start” (removes a key downside tail risk for New England).\n- Seahawks QB Sam Darnold is listed as limited with an oblique (potentially performance-limiting for a QB even if active).\n- Seahawks added two running backs to the active roster for Super Bowl LX (suggests last-minute depth/health concerns in the RB room, but impact unclear without inactives).\n- Weather at Levi’s projects mild (~67°F) with no clear extreme condition indicated (not outcome-moving on its own).\n</new_information>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe market is near a pure coin flip (50.3% Seahawks). The most material late-breaking change is quarterback health: Maye trending clearly “in” and fully practicing is meaningfully stabilizing for the Patriots, while an oblique limitation for Seattle’s QB is a potential negative (QB oblique issues can reduce velocity/comfort). The RB elevations are a weaker signal but slightly consistent with Seattle managing health/depth.
