That matters disproportionately in a single game because a few chunk plays can swing win probability quickly.\n- Drake Maye’s “tight-window” tendency (17.3% of attempts) is risky, but it also signals a high-ceiling passing game—again, valuable in a one-off.\n- The Patriots’ playoff path (16-3, 28-16, 10-7) suggests they can win in lower-variance, defense-led games. That style tends to keep underdogs live (and makes a 57/43 split feel a bit rich unless Seattle has a very large overall efficiency edge).\n- Seattle’s explosive-play differential being best in the NFL is a real pro-Seattle signal, but it’s already likely priced in.
