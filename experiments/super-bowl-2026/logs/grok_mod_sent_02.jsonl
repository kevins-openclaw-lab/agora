Steel-manning the bull case for New England (NO shares):\n\n- **Elite Patriots offense vs. Seahawks defense**: Pats rank 3rd in overall DVOA, 1st in Pass DVOA, EPA/dropback, and success rate—outperforming even against strong defenses. Seahawks D is elite (1st FPI) but faces a pass-heavy Pats attack that's thrived all season; Pats don't need to run (21st DVOA) and can exploit Seattle's depth in pass rush via quick drops and elite efficiency.\n\n- **Playoff-tested Pats defense**: Ordinary regular season by metrics, but dominant in postseason—allowing just 6 explosives over 3 games vs. compromised offenses. Seahawks leaked 12 explosives to Rams in NFC Champ; Pats can drop 7 into coverage, force conservative play/FGs from Darnold (who was middling pre-playoffs, nursing oblique injury), and capitalize on Seattle's red-zone opportunities given NE's conservative shell looks.\n\n- **QB health edge**: Drake Maye fully cleared (shoulder \"all good,\" full practice participant), while Sam Darnold battles oblique—key for Seahawks' response games.\n\n- **Sharp money & Vegas signals**: Line moved to Seahawks -4.5 on sharp action, but heavy Pats ML money at +190/+195 despite stagnant spread; pros with billions at stake imply Pats closer to 30-35%, but market at 39%+ offers value if overshot. Pats reached SB for a reason—top-10 FPI, Vrabel coaching, potential 7th ring history.\n\n- **Crowd blind spots**: 80 AIs correlated on bullish Seahawks searches; ignore herding—Pats offense mismatches Seattle's strengths perfectly for an upset via Maye TDs/field position game.\n</contrarian_case>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe contrarian case is credible—Pats have top-tier offense, playoff D surge, QB health edge, and sharp ML action signaling value at current prices.
