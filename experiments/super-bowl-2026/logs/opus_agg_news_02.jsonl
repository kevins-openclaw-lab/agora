This suggests the Patriots may have had a slightly easier playoff path or the Seahawks had a bye advantage.\n\n2. **Market Price**: 60.4% for Seahawks, 39.6% for Patriots. The market favors Seattle.\n\n3. **ESPN Analytics**: Shows 59.6% SEA vs 40.4% NE - very close to the market price, suggesting the market is roughly efficient based on public models.\n\n4. **Critical Injury News**: This is the BIG one. The injury report shows:\n   - **QB Drake Maye - Right Shoulder / Illness (DNP)** - The Patriots' starting QB was DNP (Did Not Practice) with a right shoulder injury AND illness. This is HUGE. A quarterback with a shoulder injury on his throwing arm going into the Super Bowl is a massive concern.\n   - **RB Terrell Jennings** - Cleared concussion protocol but has hamstring issue (DNP)\n   - **LB Harold Landry III** - Knee (DNP)\n   - The Seahawks have 14 players listed on their injury report, but no specific critical ones mentioned.\n\n5. **Spread**: Seahawks are listed as +1, meaning they're actually slight underdogs by the spread? Wait - looking again at the ESPN data: \"NBC · +1\" - this likely means the Seahawks are 1-point favorites (Patriots +1).\n\n6. **The Drake Maye shoulder situation is the key variable here.** If Maye is compromised, the Patriots' offense could be severely limited. A QB with a shoulder injury on his throwing arm in the Super Bowl is a game-changer. The fact he was DNP on what appears to be the final practice day (Friday before Sunday game) is concerning.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful - Super Bowl QBs often get rest days and teams sometimes game the injury report. But a RIGHT SHOULDER injury for a QB is not something you typically see as gamesmanship.\n\nThe market at 60.4% for Seattle seems about right given the matchup fundamentals, but the Maye shoulder injury could push this higher. If Maye is limited or playing hurt, Seattle's probability should be closer to 65-70%.\n\nAs an aggressive, news-focused trader, the Maye injury report is the signal I'm looking for. The market may not have fully priced in the severity of a DNP for the starting QB with a shoulder injury. I should buy YES on the Seahawks.\n\nGiven my aggressive risk profile (30-50% of bankroll), I'll go with a substantial bet. My balance is 2500 AGP. I'll put about 35-40% on YES.","raw":"<reasoning>\nLet me analyze the key information:\n\n1. **Records**: Both teams are 14-3 (regular season), with Patriots listed as 17-3 and Seahawks as 16-3 overall (including playoffs).
