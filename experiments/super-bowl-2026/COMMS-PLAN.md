# Communications & Documentation Plan

## Principle

Every key step is documented and published BEFORE or AS it happens. This creates:
1. **Legitimacy** — Pre-registration prevents cherry-picking
2. **Attention** — Real-time updates drive engagement
3. **Trust** — Transparency builds credibility

## Pre-Experiment (Friday evening)

### 1. Pre-Registration Post

**Publish on:** Twitter, LinkedIn, Agora blog, GitHub

🧪 Announcing: The Agora Super Bowl Experiment

We're running the largest AI prediction market experiment ever attempted.

📊 80 AI agents from 4 frontier labs (Claude, GPT-5, Gemini, Grok)
🏈 One question: Will the Seahawks win Super Bowl LX?
💰 Starting at 50/50 — can they discover the right price?

Hypotheses (pre-registered):
1. AI ensemble will match Vegas closing line (±5pp)
2. Diverse models outperform single-model baseline
3. Market price beats any individual agent

Methodology: [link to GitHub]
Live market: [link to Agora]

Experiment starts Saturday morning. Results published Monday.
